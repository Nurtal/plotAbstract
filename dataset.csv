27432171	Journal Article	To report the experience of our center with the use of adalimumab (ADA) for the treatment of severe refractory noninfectious paediatric uveitis. The study is a retrospective case series of all paediatric patients with refractory uveitis who were treated with ADA at the Paediatric Uveitis Unit of our center from 2008 to 2015. We present 12 patients (6 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis-associated uveitis, 4 idiopathic panuveitis, 1 early-onset sarcoidosis-associated panuveitis, and 1 intermediate uveitis), with uveitis in 19/24 eyes. Once ADA therapy was started, all the patients presented improved activity according to Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN) criteria. Nine out of the 12 patients had structural damage before ADA could be started: cataract (n = 4), glaucoma (n = 2), cystic macular edema (n = 1), exudative retinal detachment (n = 1), and optic disk edema (n = 5). Visual acuity improved or maintained stable in 17/19 affected eyes, and only 2 eyes decreased its visual acuity because of structural damage, which was already present before ADA therapy. In our experience, ADA presents a good safety profile and is efficacious in the treatment of paediatric patients with different forms of refractory noninfectious uveitis.

20131262	Clinical Trial, Phase I	We undertook this study to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of LY2439821, a humanized anti-interleukin-17 (anti-IL-17) monoclonal antibody, in a first in-human trial in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study consisted of 2 parts. In part A, 20 patients received 1 intravenous (IV) dose of LY2439821 (0.06, 0.2, 0.6, or 2.0 mg/kg, escalating) or placebo followed by 8 weeks of evaluation. End points included safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. In part B, 77 patients received 1 IV dose of LY2439821 (0.2, 0.6, or 2.0 mg/kg) or placebo every 2 weeks for a total of 5 doses, with a total evaluation period of 16 weeks. End points included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, and efficacy (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28] and percentages of patients meeting American College of Rheumatology 20%, 50%, or 70% improvement criteria [achieving an ACR20, ACR50, or ACR70 response]). The primary efficacy end point was the DAS28 at week 10. Baseline characteristics were similar across all groups. Changes in the DAS28 were significantly greater in the 0.2 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and all-LY2439821-combined groups (-2.3, -2.4, and -2.3, respectively) than in the placebo group (-1.7) at week 10 (P &lt; or = 0.05), and these differences were significant as early as week 1. Percentages of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses as well as improvements in the ACR core set of measures were greater in LY2439821-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients at multiple time points. There was no apparent dose-response relationship in treatment-emergent adverse events. LY2439821 added to oral DMARDs improved signs and symptoms of RA, with no strong adverse safety signal noted. This first evaluation of LY2439821 supports neutralization of IL-17 as a potential novel goal for the treatment of RA.

28880697	Journal Article	To determine the tentative diagnostic criteria and disease severity classification for Castleman disease (CD) and describe the clinical and pathologic features among human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) negative idiopathic multicentric CD (iMCD) in the Japanese population. We established the working groups for the research of CD in Japan and had meetings to discuss and define the tentative diagnostic criteria and disease severity classification for CD. We subsequently analyzed 142 patients classified into iMCD by using the nationwide Japanese patient registry. We proposed the preliminary diagnostic criteria and disease severity classification for CD based on our discussion. In addition, we made a proposal for the disease activity score. We identified clinical and pathological features of patients with iMCD diagnosed by these diagnostic criteria. In the disease severity classification, 37, 33 and 30% patients were categorized into mild, moderate and severe diseases, respectively. This is the first proposal for diagnosis and classification of CD by the Japanese group. Further studies are required to validate whether they can distinguish CD from other inflammatory diseases and to determine their sensitivity and specificity.

21922187	Journal Article	This study aims to demonstrate the effect of omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) supplements on the clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations, disease activity, functional capacity, response criteria as well as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients. Twenty-seven JIA patients were included in this study. Dietary supplements of ω-3 FAs 2 g/day were given for 12 weeks. Juvenile arthritis disease activity score in 27 joints (JADAS-27) and pediatric American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria were determined. Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) was used to measure the functional status. Assessment of serum IL-1 and TNF-α level was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mean age of the patients was 12.78 ± 3.26 years, the disease duration was 5.93 ± 3.06 years, and the age at disease onset was 6.78 ± 3.26 years. The TNF-α and IL-1 were significantly higher in the JIA patients compared to the control. There was a significant improvement of active joint count, number of swollen joints, JADAS-27, CHAQ, TNF-α, and IL-1 levels. The pediatric ACR response criteria improved in 92.59% of the patients. The daily requirements of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) obviously decreased. ω-3 FAs supplements reduce the inflammatory response and improve the clinical manifestation in JIA patient. The daily intake of NSAID dose decreased thus reducing the risk of related side effects. Our results support the use of omega-3 fatty acids as an add-on therapy to conventional treatment of JIA.

25935351	Journal Article	Depression is more common among individuals with chronic physical illness than in the general population. New treatments for severe and chronic inflammatory conditions which inhibit tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, may be able to shed some light on the role of inflammatory mediators in depression. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials determined the effects of TNF-α inhibitor therapy on depression and anxiety in people with chronic physical illness. Seven databases were searched from inception to January 2014: AMED, Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Articles were screened for inclusion independently by two reviewers. Data extraction and appraisal were conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Six randomised controlled trials (reported in seven articles) met eligibility criteria and were included in the final review. In total 2540 participants were enrolled across the trials, with participants presenting with rheumatoid arthritis (n=3 trials), psoriasis (n=2) or ankylosing spondylitis (n=1). Meta-analyses, using standardised mean differences, showed evidence of small reductions in depression (-0.24; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.14; p&lt;0.001), and anxiety (-0.17; 95% CI -0.31 to -0.02; p=0.02). TNF-α inhibitor therapy reduces depression in people with chronic disease though the effects are small. Whilst this is consistent with inflammation contributing to the development of depression, further studies investigating a more detailed timeline of changes in depression, inflammatory biomarkers and disease activity status are required.

29452298	Journal Article	IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is an autoimmune disease triggering an inflammatory cascade that leads to fibrosis. Outcome measures are limited and treatment options remain underexplored. To assess the variation of the IgG4 responder index (IgG4-RI) in a cohort of IgG4-RD patients and to explore their treatments and outcomes. We studied the clinical phenotype, severity of the disease and response to treatment in an ambispective multicenter cohort study including 14 different hospitals in Spain. All patients met the 2012 international consensus on pathology criteria for diagnosis. Sixty-eight patients were included, with a mean age of 53.4 years and predominance of male sex. The most commonly involved tissues were: retroperitoneum (33%), orbital pseudotumor (28%) and maxillary and paranasal sinuses (24%). IgG4-RI values were higher in patients with multiorgan disease and before treatment. After being treated, IgG4-RI values were lower, in accordance with the high rates of treatment response. Most patients received: glucocorticoids (GC), surgery, azathioprine (AZA), mofetil mycophenolate or rituximab. GC alone, GC plus surgery and GC plus AZA were given in the most of the IgG4-RD disease activity episodes. All treatments had high response rates but relapses and flares were common. IgG4-RI is a promising outcome measure in IgG4-RD, but still in development. Treatment algorithms are ill defined. GC and rituximab are the drugs with more evidence available. Disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs may have a role in IgG4-RD and warrant more prospective studies.

26947438	Journal Article	To discuss current terminology and the regulatory standards and processes involved in the development of biosimilars. An Internet-based literature search through April 2015 was performed for information related to biosimilars in chronic inflammatory disorders. Keywords were as follows: biosimilar, development, manufacturing, characterization, structural, functional, preclinical, clinical, immunogenicity, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn׳s disease, ulcerative colitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) websites were searched for guidelines and information related to biosimilars. Biosimilars are products that are highly similar to the reference product regarding quality, biological activity, safety, and efficacy. Biosimilars are biological products and not generic drugs and, thus, do not follow the same regulatory pathways as generic molecules. Rigorous early-stage structural, functional, and analytical testing, followed by nonclinical and clinical analyses comparing a biosimilar with its reference product, are required to demonstrate biosimilarity in regulatory markets worldwide. The addition of biosimilars to the market has the potential to improve access to biologic therapies. Many regulatory agencies have enacted stringent pathways, which must be followed for a biosimilar to be labeled and approved as such; following the pathways will help protect and maintain the integrity, quality, and safety of the biosimilar product.

17983157	Journal Article	In the last decade, the analysis of gene expression in tissues and cells has evolved from the analysis of a selected set of genes to an efficient high throughput whole-genome screening approach of potentially all genes expressed. Development of sophisticated methodologies such as microarray technology allows an open-ended survey to identify comprehensively the fraction of genes that are differentially expressed between samples and that define the samples\&#39; unique biology. By a global analysis of the genes that are expressed in cells and tissues of an individual under different conditions and during disease, we can build up \&quot;gene expression profiles (signatures)\&quot; which characterize the dynamic functioning of the genome under pathophysiological conditions. This strategy also provides the means to subdivide patients that suffer from a complex heterogeneous disease into more homogeneous subgroups. Such discovery-based research identifies biological processes that may include new genes with unknown function or genes not previously known to be involved in this process. The latter category may hold surprises that sometimes urge us to redirect our thinking. We have used microarrays to disclose the heterogeneity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients at the level of gene expression of the affected synovial tissues. Analysis of the expression profiles of synovial tissues from different patients with RA revealed considerable variability, resulting in the identification of at least two molecularly distinct forms of RA tissues. One is characterized by genes that indicate an active inflammatory infiltrate with high immunoglobulin production, whereas the other type shows little immune activation and instead shows a higher stromal cell activity. These results confirm the heterogeneous nature of RA and suggest the existence of distinct pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to RA. The differences in expression profiles provide opportunities to stratify patients for intervention therapies based on molecular criteria.

24762839	Journal Article	Data on the relationship between osteoporosis and osteoarthritis are conflicting. Most studies report \&quot;snapshot\&quot; prevalences, and there are few studies evaluating localized knee bone mineral density (BMD) measurements with respect to subsequent osteoarthritis progression. The authors hypothesize that increased mediolateral difference of the proximal tibial BMD may predict progression of knee osteoarthritis. In this study, 246 female volunteers were followed up prospectively over 2 years. Baseline BMD measurements of bilateral proximal (subchondral) tibiae were performed, and the mediolateral BMD ratio was calculated. Precision studies were performed on healthy volunteers to validate the technique. The patients were divided into osteoarthritis progressors and non-progressors based on Kellgren-Lawrence radiographic criteria at 2-year follow-up. Patients who were taking bisphosphonates or who had a history of inflammatory, infectious, or metabolic bone disease and previous hip and knee surgery were excluded. Demographic data, calcium supplementation, physical activity, baseline knee radiographs, and radiographs at 2-year follow-up were obtained. The study was adequately powered to detect an effect size of 0.4. There were 121 progressors and 125 non-progressors. Mean mediolateral BMD ratio was 1.02 among the progressors and 1.01 among the non-progressors (t=0.632, P=.528). Potential confounders were equally distributed among both groups. The data suggest that there is no link between proximal tibial BMD ratio and progression of knee osteoarthritis.

21149498	Journal Article	To identify predictors of response to methotrexate (MTX) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the SWEFOT trial, patients with RA with symptom duration &lt;1 year started MTX monotherapy (20 mg/weekly) and 405/487 continued until the 3-4- month visit. The primary outcome measure was the DAS28-based European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Multivariate logistic regression was used to study the association between response and the following baseline characteristics: gender, age, symptom duration, cigarette smoking habits, autoantibody status, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score, concurrent prednisolone and treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Secondary response and remission measures were the American College of Rheumatology and the Simple Disease Activity Index and Clinical Disease Activity Index (SDAI/CDAI)-derived criteria. After 3-4 months of MTX treatment, the frequency of EULAR good/moderate/no response was 34%/41%/25%, respectively. Parameters associated with a decreased likelihood of EULAR response were female gender (adjusted OR (adj OR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.81), symptom duration (adj OR per month increase 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.99), current smoking (adj OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.63) and higher HAQ (adj OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.80). Parameters associated with an increased likelihood of EULAR response were higher age (adj OR per 10-year increase 1.30, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.51) and prednisolone treatment (adj OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.63). The findings were similar when patients on prednisolone were excluded and other response criteria tested, although current smoking was the only significant predictor using all response criteria, while HAQ was the only significant predictor of all the remission criteria used. A matrix showed up to ninefold differences between subgroups stratified by the main predictors. Current smoking, female sex, longer symptom duration and younger age predict a worse response to MTX in patients with new-onset RA. TrialRegNo NCT00764725.

28966205	Journal Article	To develop a Canadian Rheumatoid Arthritis Core Clinical Dataset (CAN-RACCD) to standardize documentation encouraging high-quality care. A set of candidate elements was drafted through meetings with 27 rheumatologists, researchers, and patients, and supplemented with focused literature reviews. A 3-round online-modified Delphi consensus process was held with rheumatologists (n = 26), allied health professionals (n = 7), and patients (n = 4); for the remainder there was no demographic information. Participants rated both the importance and feasibility of documenting candidate elements on a Likert scale of 1-9, contributed to an online moderated discussion, and re-rated the elements for inclusion in the CAN-RACCD. Elements were included in the final set if importance and feasibility ratings had a median score of ≥ 6.5 and there was no disagreement among participants. Fifty-five individual elements in 10 subgroups were proposed to the Delphi participants: measures of RA disease activity; dates to calculate waiting times, disease duration, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug start; comorbidities; smoking status; patient-reported pain and fatigue; physical function; laboratory and radiographic investigations; medications; clinical characteristics; and vaccines. All groups were included in the final set, with the exception of vaccination status. Additionally, 3 individual elements from the smoking subgroup were eliminated with a recommendation to record smoking status as never/ever/current, and 2 elements relating to coping and effect of fatigue were eliminated due to low feasibility and importance ratings. The CAN-RACCD stands as a national recommendation on which data elements should be routinely collected in clinical practice to monitor and support high-quality RA care.

28685724	Journal Article	Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a well-established imaging modality which has been put into clinical use in recent years with the development of second-generation contrast agent and imaging devices, and its applications in the assessment of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, have provoked abundant discussion and researches among radiologists and rheumatologists. To summarize the achievements of clinical studies on CEUS in the application of arthritis, and to keep up with the latest progresses of the imaging technique, we reviewed the literature in recent years, hoping to establish the role of CEUS in joint diseases. PubMed and EMBASE. We searched the database with the conditions \&quot;contrast-enhanced ultrasound AND arthritis\&quot; with the time limitation of recent 10 years. Clinical studies applying CEUS in inflammatory arthritis and review articles about development of CEUS in joint diseases in English were selected. As it is proved by most studies in recent years, by delineating microvasculature within the inflamed joints, CEUS can indicate early arthritis with high sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the imaging of CEUS has been proved to be consistent with histopathological changes of inflammatory arthritis. Quantitative analysis of CEUS permits further evaluation of disease activity. CEUS also plays a significant role in the therapeutic monitoring of the disease, which has been backed up by a number of studies. CEUS may be a new choice for the rheumatologists to evaluate inflammatory arthritis, because of its low price, ability to provide dynamic pictures, and high sensitivity to angiogenesis. It can also be applied in disease classification and therapeutic monitoring. More studies about CEUS need to be done to set up the diagnostic standards.

2487701	Journal Article	The management of the rheumatoid patient involves the considered use of pharmacologic agents as therapies to induce symptomatic relief and to reduce disease activity. Aspirin and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs are used initially to lessen the degree of pain and swelling associated with the inflammatory disease process. The aggressive institution of second-line therapy, previously known as disease-modifying antiinflammatory rheumatic drugs, is advocated to modify the disease course itself. These second-line treatments include antimalarials, gold salts, methotrexate, d-penicillamine, and azathioprine. Randomized placebo controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in this illness. Improvement in standard parameters of disease activity (number of painful and swollen joints, duration of morning stiffness, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) can be related to the therapeutic value of second-line agents. Whether they modify radiographic progression is under rigorous study. Newer therapies under research investigation include sulfasalazine, cyclosporin A, and combination therapy.

24656623	Journal Article	Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are the consequence of a persistent imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immune mechanisms, leading to chronic inflammation. The objective of this study was to determine whether the high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and cytokines are elevated in RA patients and to investigate the relationship between these markers and disease activity in RA, measured by disease activity score 28 (DAS28). We studied 110 RA patients according to American College of Rheumatology revised criteria for RA, and 55 controls matched by age and sex. Serum levels of hs-CRP and cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were estimated and correlated with the DAS28. Serum hs-CRP was assayed immunoturbidimetrically and cytokines were analysed by commercially available ELISA kit. We found that RA patients had significantly higher levels of serum hs-CRP (p&lt;0.001), IL-6 (p&lt;0.001), TNF-α (p&lt;0.001), and IL-10 (p&lt;0.01) as compared to healthy controls. hs-CRP, IL-6 and TNF-α correlated positively (p&lt;0.001) and IL-10 correlated negatively (p&lt;0.01) with DAS28. These results demonstrate that RA patients have high levels of inflammatory markers, and these levels are correlated with the DAS28. These findings suggest a possible role of these markers in the pathogenesis of RA. Moreover, these biomarkers can be used as markers of disease activity in the diagnosis and treatment of RA.

16960935	Clinical Trial, Phase I	To investigate safety and tolerability and pilot efficacy of repeated single doses of Org39141 in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Org 39141 is recombinant human cartilage glycoprotein-39, intended to induce mucosal tolerance upon intranasal administration. RA patients with moderate disease activity were treated for 4 weeks and followed for another 8 weeks. The trial had a sequential cohort design: RA patients in the first cohort received 4 intranasal doses (one per week) of either 25 microg Org 39141 or placebo; in subsequent cohorts, treatment with 125microg, 625 microg, or 3125 microg Org39141 was compared to placebo. Safety was evaluated by means of reporting adverse events, standard laboratory testing, and nose examination. The primary efficacy endpoint was RA disease activity as measured by the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28). A total of 36 patients were randomized. Org39141 was well tolerated, and no severe or serious adverse events (AE) were reported. In the pooled placebo group, a decrease in DAS28 was observed, but to a lesser extent than in the Org 39141 treatment groups. After 4 weeks of treatment, the mean decrease in DAS in the 625 microg Org 39141 treatment group (-24%) was statistically (p = 0.02) and clinically (EULAR criteria) significantly larger than in the pooled placebo group (-3%). Once-weekly intranasal treatment with Org39141 was well tolerated, and no serious or severe AE were reported. A trend towards efficacy was observed. Our results are encouraging for further clinical development of Org39141.	NA	The Journal of rheumatology	4.Bronze	Intranasal administration of recombinant human cartilage glycoprotein-39.

1859490	Clinical Trial	We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial comparing azathioprine (AZA) and methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis in whom parenteral gold and/or D-penicillamine treatment had been unsuccessful. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either AZA (100 mg daily) or oral MTX (7.5 mg weekly). After 8 weeks, the dosage was increased depending on the clinical improvement. Sixty-four patients were followed up for 48 weeks (33 AZA, 31 MTX). Comparison of values at week 24 with baseline values revealed significant improvement in 12 of 13 disease variables in the MTX group and in 6 of 13 in the AZA group. Comparison between the 2 treatment groups at 24 weeks, by area-under-the-curve analysis, showed significantly more improvement in the MTX group in terms of the swollen joint count, pain score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, hemoglobin level, thrombocyte level, and disease activity score. A significant overall clinical improvement (disease activity score) was found in 7 of 20 patients treated with AZA and 18 of 30 patients treated with MTX after 24 weeks of therapy, and in 6 of 12 AZA-treated patients and 19 of 25 MTX-treated patients after 48 weeks. The number of withdrawals due to side effects was significantly higher in the AZA group. After 48 weeks, only 12 patients from the AZA group (36%), but 25 from the MTX group (81%), were still using the initial drug. These results demonstrate MTX to be superior to AZA in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with a more rapid clinical improvement which is sustained after 1 year, accompanied by a lower rate of serious adverse reactions.

2155456	Comparative Study	Forty hands of 39 patients with rheumatic joint disease were examined by MRT. The method differentiates between inflammatory exudative and proliferative processes in soft tissues and bone. T2-weighted images provided criteria for judging the activity of the disease. MRT provided better demonstration of the soft tissues than just conventional radiography. The methods were of equal value for showing bone lesions. MRT is suitable as a means of diagnosing rheumatoid changes in the hand.

15776142	English Abstract	There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are characterized by acceleration of atherosclerotic process of arterial wall. However, all investigations performed so far to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis in RA included subjects without selection for age and degree of disease activity that may represent confounding factors in such an evaluation. To verify signs of accelerated subclinical atherosclerosis in young subject suffering from RA but with low disease activity. Thirty-two patients with RA and 28 age- and sex-matched control subjects with non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were age less than 60 and low disease activity with score &lt; or =3.2 according to DAS28, while subjects with traditional risk factors for and/or overt cardiovascular disease were ruled out from the study. Both patients and controls underwent evaluation of carotid and femoral artery intima-media thickness by ultrasounds. Patients had higher intima-media thickness than controls of all the sites evaluated at carotid artery level, whereas there were no differences at the comparison of the superficial and common femoral artery wall. At the univariate analysis, a positive correlation between LDL cholesterol levels and intima-media thickness at the carotid bifurcation was found. Young patients with RA and low disease activity have acceleration of atherosclerosis development as shown by increased intima-media thickness of carotid artery with respect to subjects without inflammatory rheumatic disease. It is conceivable that the organic damage of arterial wall could be the result of persistent endothelial dysfunction induced by chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation which characterize RA.

23653309	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease with typical onset between the ages of 40 and 50 years. Increasing levels of physical activity (PA) have been shown to decrease inflammation, reduce pain, increase functional ability and improve self-esteem in people with RA. Health behaviour change (HBC) interventions have recently shown promise in facilitating the promotion of PA within a range of long-term conditions. There is currently no evidence synthesis relating to HBC interventions to increase PA in the RA population. The aim of the present study was to determine whether HBC interventions can increase PA in people with RA and identify optimal interventions or promising constituent components of the HBC interventions. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized, controlled trials investigating the effect of HBC interventions on PA level in adults with RA. Four review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of studies and extracted data based upon predefined criteria. Following the application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, three studies remained for inclusion. Two studies reported significant short-term (&lt;9 months) beneficial effects of HBC upon PA (p &lt; 0.05). Individualized interventions were significantly more effective (p &lt; 0.05). Due to methodological flaws and a lack of comparison with usual care, it is not possible to conclude whether HBC interventions can increase PA in the RA population. Although it is possible to highlight promising elements of HBC interventions, such as goal setting and feedback on performance, further research on all specific components, including information provision, behaviour contracts and problem solving, is required to establish conclusive clinical guidelines.

26725019	Journal Article	To evaluate the association between the clinical activity of RA patients and serum adipocytokines (Leptin, Adiponectin and Resistin) and inflammatory cytokines. All RA patients fulfilled ACR 1987 criteria and were treated with DMARDs. Adipocytokine and inflammatory cytokine levels were evaluated using ELISA. 121 patients were included in the study. Stratifying according to DAS28 (low, moderate and high activity), there were significant differences for Leptin, Resistin, IL-6 and IL-17, however, no differences were seen for Adiponectin, TNFα or IL-1β. Clinical activity positively correlated with Leptin, Resistin, IL-17 and IL-6 levels, but not with Adiponectin, TNFα or IL-1β. Adiponectin levels negatively correlated with TNFα and positively correlated with IL-1β. IL-1β positively correlated with IL-6 and negatively correlated with TNFα and IL-17. Circulating Leptin, Resistin, IL-6 and IL-17 levels positively correlate with RA clinical activity in a manner independent of the subject\&#39;s BMI. Complex relationships between inflammatory cytokines were observed in RA patients suggesting that other metabolic or inflammatory factors could be involved.

18253972	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the musculoskeletal system. Inflammation of the joints and tendons results in pain, swelling and restricted movement, eventually leading to radiological changes and deformities. Exercise therapy is considered to be an important cornerstone of the treatment of RA in all stages of the disease. To assess the effects of dynamic exercise therapy in improving joint mobility, muscle strength, aerobic capacity and daily functioning in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, possible unwanted effects such as an increase in pain, disease activity and radiological progression were studied. We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal trials register, the Cochrane Controlled trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and SCISEARCH databases up to May 1997 in order to controlled trials on the effect of exercise therapy. Randomized trials on the effect of dynamic exercise therapy in RA patients with an exercise program fulfilling the following criteria: a) intensity level such that heart rates exceeded 60% of maximal heart rate during at least 20 minutes, b) exercise frequency of two sessions per week, and c) duration of intervention of greater than six weeks Two blinded reviewers independently selected eligible studies, rated the methodological quality and extracted data. Six out of 30 identified controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Four of the six included studies fulfilled at least seven out of 10 methodological criteria. Due to heterogeneity in outcome measures, data could not be pooled. The results suggest that dynamic exercise therapy is effective at increasing aerobic capacity and muscle strength. No detrimental effects on disease activity and pain were observed. The effects of dynamic exercise therapy on functional ability and radiological progression are unclear. The results suggest that dynamic exercise therapy is effective at increasing aerobic capacity and muscle strength. No detrimental effects on disease activity and pain were observed.

781231	Clinical Trial	The benefit-to-risk ratios of fenoprofen (2.4 gm/day) and aspirin (3.9 gm/day) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, 26-week parallel study involving 216 patients. Criteria for inclusion, exclusion, subjective, and objective evaluations were based on the PMA-FDA Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug Clinical Testing Guidelines. Thirty-four of 109 aspirin-treated patients and 23 of 107 patients on fenoprofen dropped out of the study. Both fenoprofen and aspirin brought about improvement in most efficacy parameters measured, but fenoprofen was superior to aspirin (p less than 0.05) in reduction of swollen joints, grip strength, activity index, and patients\&#39; preference of medication. The number and frequency of complaints and the incidence of abnormal SGOT levels, were greater with aspirin than with fenoprofen. The study suggests that fenoprofen has a better benefit-to-risk ratio than aspirin, when given in equally effective doses.

24665602	Journal Article	Statins, which appear to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our study sought to determine the association of statins use with disease activity and functional status in a group of patients with RA. A cross-sectional study was performed in 209 Puerto Ricans with RA (per the 1987 classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology). Demographic features, lifestyle-related behaviors, disease activity (per Disease Activity Score 28), comorbid conditions, functional status (per Health Assessment Questionnaire), pharmacologic therapy, and patients\&#39; and physicians\&#39; global assessments using visual analogue scales, were determined. Data were examined using univariate, bivariate, and multiple logistic regression analyses. The mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of the study population at study visit was 56.8 (13.5) years (range: 24-86 years); 175 patients (83.7%) were women. The mean (SD) disease duration was 10.4 (9.5) years (range: 0.0-44.0 years). Thirty-two (15.3%) patients were using statins at study visit, and 36 (17.2%) had used statins in the past. In the multivariable analysis, the current use of statins was associated with higher functional status (odds ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.80) than was nonuse, after adjusting for age, disease duration, arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dyslipidemia. No association between either current or past use of statins and disease activity was found. In this group of RA patients, the current use of statins was associated with a higher functional status; conversely, no association was found between statins use and disease activity. However, larger and longitudinal studies are required to confirm these findings.

24334647	Journal Article	To assess the predictive value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected subclinical inflammation for subsequent radiographic progression in a longitudinal study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical remission or low disease activity (LDA), and to determine cutoffs for an MRI inflammatory activity acceptable state in RA in which radiographic progression rarely occurs. Patients with RA in clinical remission [28-joint Disease Activity Score-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) &lt; 2.6, n = 185] or LDA state (2.6 ≤ DAS28-CRP &lt; 3.2, n = 69) with longitudinal MRI and radiographic data were included from 5 cohorts (4 international centers). MRI were assessed according to the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) RA MRI scoring system (RAMRIS). Statistical analyses included an underlying conditional logistic regression model stratified per cohort, with radiographic progression as dependent variable. A total of 254 patients were included in the multivariate analyses. At baseline, synovitis was observed in 95% and osteitis in 49% of patients. Radiographic progression was observed in 60 patients (24%). RAMRIS synovitis was the only independent predictive factor in multivariate analysis. ROC analysis identified a cutoff value for baseline RAMRIS synovitis score of 5 (maximum possible score 21). Rheumatoid factor (RF) status yielded a significant interaction with synovitis (p value = 0.044). RF-positive patients with a RAMRIS synovitis score of &gt; 5 vs ≤ 5, had an OR of 4.4 (95% CI 1.72-11.4) for radiographic progression. High MRI synovitis score predicts radiographic progression in patients in clinical remission/LDA. A cutoff point for determining an MRI inflammatory activity acceptable state based on the RAMRIS synovitis score was established. Incorporating MRI in future remission criteria should be considered.

12474726	Comparative Study	The paper describes the typical clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis and principles of its treatment. It includes an overview of the universally accepted diagnostic criteria and discusses the diagnostic value of laboratory and instrumental investigations. The significance of correct diagnosis in an early stage of the disease is emphasized with regard to the difficulties related to differential diagnosis. Appropriate evaluation of the inflammatory activity of rheumatoid arthritis and of the functional state of the patient is discussed. Contemporary principles of complex and individual treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, depending on the course of disease are presented, placing special emphasis on the importance of disease--modifying treatment. Possible side effects of NSAIDs and glucocorticosteroids and methods of their prevention are discussed, as well as indications for new biological medications.

6143138	Clinical Trial	A 10-year study of the management of rheumatoid arthritis was conducted to compare a programme consisting of rest and anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs with one consisting of maintenance of activity, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs, and systemic steroids where necessary. During this period subjects who did not respond to the treatment allocated went on to a combined treatment programme of rest, anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic drugs, and steroids. Among those who remained in the trial for the 10 years, there was little difference between the two groups in morning stiffness, number of inflamed joints, functional capacity, grip strength, number of American Rheumatism Association criteria present, and whether they remained on their original treatment programme or switched to the combined programme. However, in those who started in the steroid group, the condition of several joints tended to be better clinically and radiologically than in those of the other group during and at the end of 10 years of the original treatment programme, at time of transfer to the combined programme, and at the completion of the combined programme. Both groups had as many complications of disease and treatment, and adverse effects attributable to steroids seemed to be restricted to those with severe disease who had not responded to their original programme. A policy of maintaining physical activity plus the judicious use of steroids where required produces, in the long term, results as good as or probably better than a regimen of bed rest and no steroids.

16220229	Journal Article	Nutritional supplements, such as Seatone, which contain freeze-dried tissue from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus, are sold in many countries to relieve arthritic symptoms and to aid in the regeneration of arthritic and injured joints. Searches for all published controlled trials on the clinical effectiveness of green-lipped mussel, as a nutritional supplement with potential health benefits for arthritis, were carried out from four independent databases. No language restrictions were imposed, and the review was undertaken from extracted data and was assessed critically according to predefined criteria by the authors. Reports of clinical studies, using freeze-dried mussel powder, show mixed outcome measures and are not conclusive, with only two of five randomized controlled trials attesting benefits for rheumatoid and osteoarthritis patients. Similarly, animal studies have likewise yielded mixed findings. In both these cases possibly due to the lack of stabilization of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, now known to be the basis of anti-inflammatory activity. There is little consistent and compelling evidence, to date, in the therapeutic use of freeze-dried green-lipped mussel powder products for rheumatoid or osteoarthritis treatment, particularly in comparison to other cheaper alternative nutriceutical supplements of proven efficacy. However, further investigations are necessary to determine whether green-lipped mussel supplements, such as Seatone, are therapeutic options in the management of arthritis.

9266130	Journal Article	The randomized controlled clinical trial is the \&quot;gold standard\&quot; to evaluate therapeutic interventions, but is more effectively applied to studies of the short-term treatment of acute diseases than to the long-term treatment of chronic diseases. Clinical observations often provide more accurate outcome data in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than clinical trials. Limitations of clinical trials to depict long-term outcomes in RA include a relatively short observation period, patient selection resulting from exclusion criteria, inflexible dosage schedules and concomitant drug therapies, evidence that some markers of inflammatory activity are suboptimal surrogate indicators of long-term articular damage, the fact that statistically significant results are not necessarily clinically important, the influence of the design on the results-despite a control group, ignoring of individual variation in reporting results, the non-standardized interpretation of side effects which introduces bias, distortion of the \&quot;placebo effect\&quot;, and lack of capacity to detect rare side effects. The clinical trial represents only an initial step in the evaluation of a therapy for a chronic disease. Awareness of these limitations should lead to the improved design of clinical trials and clinical studies to improve the long-term outcome for people with RA.

26852499	Controlled Clinical Trial	Under the term \&quot;osteoarthritis\&quot; (OA) is currently meant a clinical syndrome resulting from the combined effect of articular pain and disordered functional activity leading to the deterioration of the quality of life of the patients. The principal objective of rehabilitation of the patients presenting with GA in which all patients with this condition are in need practically after each next aggravation of the pathological process is to relive pain syndrome and restore the functional ability of the joints lost or deteriorated after each exacerbation in order to eventually improve the quality of life of the patients experiencing the constantly progressing degenerative process in the musculoskeletal system. The effectiveness of pain alleviation, the degree of improvement\&#39;of the joint functional activity and the general condition of the patient are considered as the criteria for the assessment of the effectiveness of the rehabilitative treatment. These criteria have been chosen in accordance with the recommendations of the OMERACT international working group (outcome measures in rheumatology). In addition, the quality of life associated with the health status and the adverse effects of the rehabilitative measures were estimated. Bearing in mind comorbidity in the patients presenting with OA, one of the main challenges is the development of the scientifically sound rationale for the application of non-pharmacological technologies of physical therapy, remedial gymnastics and massage for the prevention and elimination of an aggravation of the secondary aseptic inflammatory process associated with OA and the subsequent rehabilitative treatment for the restoration of the lost locomotory stereotype and the quality of life of the patients. One of the effective methods of physical therapy used for the treatment and rehabilitation of the patients presenting with GA is hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy. This method makes use of the heat rejection phenomenon to which the organism responds, either in the compensatory or/and reflectory mode, by the activation of the heat production processes in the tissues due to the stimulation of the metabolic processes as well as the vascular, neuroendocrine, and immune systems involved in the regulation of homeostasis which produces the desired therapeutic effect apparent as the cessation of secondary aseptic inflammation and progressive degeneration process associated with OA. Taking into consideration the aforesaid, the objective of the present study was the scientifically sound substantiation of the application of hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy as a constituent of the combined rehabilitative treatment of the patients presenting with gonarthritis and a coxarthrosis. This article was designed to report the results of such combined treatment obtained in 110 patients (22 men and 88 women) with gonarthritis and a coxarthrosis of the II-III stages (based on the classification of Kellgren). The patients aged from 40 to 75 years which were randomly divided into two groups (the main and the control (comparison) groups) comprising 55 patients each. The patients of the main group, unlike those in the control one, were treated with the use of hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy in addition to traditional physical therapy and balneotherapy, therapeutic physical exercises, and massage. The results of the treatment were evaluated making use of the Lequesne, WOMAC, Likert international indices. It allowed to identify the predictors for the use of hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy and to increase the effectiveness of the rehabilitative treatment of the patients suffering from OA of the large joints by 33% in comparison with the control group. The highest clinical effectiveness of 90% was achieved in the cases of at a.gonarthritis; it was somewhat lower (64%) in the cases of coxarthritis.

10405518	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause severe pain and disability. Disease management historically was based on a \&quot;therapeutic pyramid\&quot; in which treatment escalated as symptoms worsened. However, the demonstration of early joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis has emphasized the importance of early identification and treatment. Key features in establishing a diagnosis include joint examinations, assessments of extra-articular manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiologic examinations. Care must be taken to rule out other disorders with symptoms that overlap those of rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis typically involves disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and low-dose corticosteroids--often used in combination. A new class of therapeutic agents designed to neutralize inflammatory cytokines has added a new dimension to the therapeutic armamentarium against rheumatoid arthritis. Etanercept, a bioengineered soluble receptor fusion protein that blocks tumor necrosis factor activity, is the first compound in this class to be approved for treatment of patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Therapeutic trials indicate that etanercept can reduce disease activity with relatively few drug-related adverse effects, thus helping persons with rheumatoid arthritis return to more normal, healthy lives.

20975634	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease whose characteristics have a clear impact on the life of the patient and his/ her family. Doctor-patient relationship is increasingly based on communication and information transfer. In the case of chronic diseases and especially in RA, that information is fundamental for a better compliance, but also for the prevention of problems and the patient\&#39;s better management of the disease on a daily basis. To determine in a population of RA patients which are the principal sources of information about the disease, what unmet needs exist and the level of patient involvement in therapeutic decision. We applied a questionnaire in person and by telephone to a population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis fulfilling the criteria of the ACR, which were followed at several departments of rheumatology in mainland Portugal, about their expectations, the degree and type of information they expected, and their unmet needs. A total of 223 RA patients filled in the questionnaire, 82.5% of which were female, mean age 55.13 +/- 14.49 years and whose mean duration of disease was above 5 years in 69.5% of the individuals. Of these, 17.5% found that RA had an impact on quality of life, 15.7% felt that RA affected their ability to enjoy life and 14.3% had difficulties in performing activities of daily living. Some activities were found to be more difficult for a patient with RA (on a scale of 0 to 10), such as gardening (6.36) and practicing sports (5.79). Other basic tasks were also considered difficult, as are the case of household chores (5.76) sleeping (5.08) walking (4.99) and working (4.86). Regarding the clinical impact of RA, as expected pain is almost a universal factor (87.9%), although the majority of patients also refer arthritis (78%), pain when moving (65.5%), fatigue (60.1%) and joint deformities (58.3%) as very common symptoms. Diminishing pain (81.2%), a general improvement of symptoms (73.1%) in a lasting way (57.4%) and reducing arthritis (59.2%) appeared as the main concerns of patients with RA. Regarding quality of information, 68.2% of patients consider they are well informed about the disease, but these numbers decrease if we consider information about treatment options (46.2%), the concept of remission (20.6%) or the recognition of the DAS 28 scale (17%). As preferred sources of information about the disease, 67.7% of individuals indicate their rheumatologist, 31.4% their general practitioner, 17% the Internet and 9% the attending nurse. The same order is obtained when asked about treatment information. As to the need for additional information, the patients refer «more information about therapies/treatments» (26.9%), «new scientific developments and social support» (17.5% each), «how to improve symptoms and live better in everyday life» (16.6%). «What is the disease» (6.7%) is referred last, being that only 8.1% of patients consider they are well informed. In what concerns discussion and participation in the process of clinical decision about medication, 56.1% of patients say that they share it with their doctors during their consultation. These results, which somewhat differ from the existing literature, demonstrate that there are important issues that should be considered in clinical practice, both relating to clinical issues and the unmet needs of our patients. We are unaware of the results coming from a treatment strategy designed to increase the RA patient\&#39;s perception of their general state of health or of their perception of function. We should, however, keep in mind that pain, wellbeing and disease activity (as well as remission) should be important goals in therapeutic strategies that are to be increasingly shared with our patients.

3318433	Clinical Trial	The safety and efficacy of nabumetone (1,000 mg at bedtime) were compared with those of aspirin (900 mg four times daily) in the treatment of osteoarthritis in adult patients in a private practice setting as part of a six-month, double-blind, controlled, randomized, parallel group study. At screening, baseline, and Days 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and 168, efficacy was evaluated according to independent assessments by the patients and the physician of overall osteoarthritic activity and pain and by the physician\&#39;s assessment with respect to a defined activity. Of the 40 patients enrolled, 37 were evaluable for efficacy (19 in the nabumetone group and 18 in the aspirin group). Demographic parameters and diagnostic criteria for osteoarthritis were comparable between the groups, although there was a preponderance of women in the nabumetone group. Significant improvement from baseline in all five efficacy parameters was observed in both groups. Safety was evaluated for all 20 enrolled patients in each group. The percentage of aspirin-treated patients who withdrew from the study due to adverse experiences was greater (60 percent versus 20 percent), as was the number with at least one treatment-related adverse experience (19, or 95 percent, versus 11, or 55 percent). Treatment-related adverse experiences described as moderate or severe were reported by 70 percent of the aspirin-treated patients and by 35 percent of the nabumetone-treated patients. In this study, nabumetone 1,000 mg at bedtime had an acceptable safety profile and was as effective as aspirin 900 mg four times daily in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

28970215	Journal Article	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been shown to improve survival rates in other inflammatory diseases. We aimed to assess the available literature on the cardiovascular impact of HCQ in patients with RA. We systematically searched for studies evaluating the effects of HCQ on cardiovascular outcomes of known risk factors for CVD in patients with RA. Databases searched were MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBase, Cochrane Library and the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism annual meetings. A meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model, estimating mean differences (MDs), HRs and 95% CIs. Data were extracted by one investigator and independently checked by another. The literature search revealed 185 articles and abstracts of interest; further examination resulted in 16 studies fulfilling the criteria. The MDs between HCQ users and non-users in levels of total, low-density and high-density cholesterol and triglycerides were -9.8 (95% CI -14.0 to -5.6), -10.6 (95% CI -14.2 to -7.0), +4.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 6.0) and -19.2 (95% CI -27.2 to -11.1), respectively. Diabetes incidence was lower for HCQ ever users than never users (HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.49 to 0.70)). HCQ seemed to decrease insulin resistance and incidence of CVD, but data were too few for meta-analysis. Besides its limited efficacy for disease activity and progression, HCQ may benefit the metabolic profile and to a lesser extent cardiovascular events in patients with RA, which suggests its usefulness combined with other conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

29652792	Journal Article	Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease. This study evaluates the effect of blue mussel intake on disease activity and quality of life in women with RA. Thirty-nine women with established RA and a disease activity score 28 (DAS28) &gt;3.0 were recruited to a randomized 2 &amp;times; 11-week cross-over dietary intervention. The participants continued with their medication and habitual diet and exchanged one cooked meal a day, five days a week, with a meal including 75 g blue mussels or 75 g meat. Diets were switched after an eight week washout period. Data regarding quality of life (SF-36), blood lipids, erythrocyte sediment rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and tender and swollen joints were examined at the start and end of each dietary period. Thirty women completed one period, and twenty-three completed both. Intake of the blue mussel diet led to a significant reduction of DAS28-CRP (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.048), but not DAS28. The number of EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) criteria moderate and good responders were higher when consuming blue mussel diet (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.036). Blood lipids did not change. To conclude, blue mussel intake reduced disease symptoms in women with RA and improved perceived health. The reported effects need to be confirmed by non-patient reported outcomes, such as inflammation markers.

28367079	Journal Article	Primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (pSS) is a systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the secretory glands. This process leads to sicca syndrome, which is the combination of dryness of the eyes, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx and/or vagina. Extraglandular manifestations may also be prevalent in patients with pSS, including cutaneous, musculoskeletal, pulmonary, renal, hematological and neurological involvement. The pathogenesis of pSS is currently not well understood, but increased activation of B cells followed by immune complex formation and autoantibody production are thought to play important roles. pSS is diagnosed using the American-European consensus group (AECG) classification criteria which include subjective symptoms and objective tests such as histopathology and serology. The treatment of pSS warrants an organ based approach, for which local treatment (teardrops, moistures) and systemic therapy (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) and biologicals) can be considered. Biologicals used in the treatment of pSS mainly affect the total numbers of B cells (B cell depletion (Rituximab)) or target proteins required for B cell proliferation and/or activation (e.g. B cell activating factor (BAFF)) resulting in decreased B cell activity. The aim of this review is to provide physicians a general overview concerning the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of pSS patients.

28583280	Journal Article	FDG is a tracer for visualizing glucose metabolism. PET/CT using FDG is widely used for the diagnosis of cancer, because glycolysis is elevated in cancer cells. Similarly, active inflammatory tissue also exhibits elevated glucose metabolism because of glycolysis in activated macrophages and proliferating fibroblasts. Elevated FDG uptake by active inflammatory tissues, such as those affected by arthritis, vasculitis, lymphadenitis, and chondritis, has enabled the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases using FDG-PET/CT. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, chronic inflammation of the joints resulting in synovitis. Several clinical studies of RA have demonstrated that FDG uptake in affected joints reflects the disease activity of RA, with strong correlations between FDG uptake and various clinical parameters having been noted. Furthermore, the use of FDG-PET for the sensitive detection and early monitoring of the response to RA therapy has been reported. RA is sometimes associated with subclinical vasculitis, which is related to systemic inflammation. FDG-PET/CT can be used to evaluate subclinical vasculitis in the aorta or carotid artery. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an autoimmune musculoskeletal disease of unknown etiology characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulder, neck, and pelvic girdle, but not in the small finger joints in the hands, together with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. There is no specific test for PMR, and its diagnosis is based on clinical diagnostic criteria and the exclusion of other diseases with similar symptoms. However, FDG-PET/CT reveals a characteristic FDG uptake by the bursitis in ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, lumbar or cervical spinous process, and scapulohumeral joint. A combination of FDG-PET/CT findings showed a high diagnostic value for PMR in a differential diagnosis from RA. FDG-PET/CT is also very useful for evaluating large vessel vasculitis, which is often associated with PMR. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare multisystem disease of unknown etiology involving cartilaginous and proteoglycan-rich structures. Its rarity and diversity of symptoms often result in a delayed diagnosis. FDG-PET/CT reveals unique FDG uptake findings for chondritis in the auricular, nasal, trachea, bronchial tree, and costal cartilage and in the cartilage of joints. Thus, the spread of knowledge regarding these very specific FDG-PET/CT findings could promote the early diagnosis and improved disease control of relapsing polychondritis.

8014927	Journal Article	An inflammatory compartment radionuclide such as Indium-111 chloride (111InCl3) may offer advantages over bone seeking radionuclides in the assessment of active rheumatoid synovitis. As an iron analog, 111InCl3 binds iron complexing proteins including transferrin. Active rheumatoid synovitis is a transferrin receptor rich compartment, reflecting profound cellular activation and proliferation. We investigated 111InCl3 scanning for the detection of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Nine patients satisfying ACR criteria for definite or probable RA were scanned twice at a 28-day interval. Patients were undergoing multiple medication changes with resultant fluctuating disease activity. Blinded readings were performed by an experienced nuclear medicine physician and correlated with simultaneous clinical examinations by a single rheumatologist. Sixteen assessed joint areas/patient and a total of 144 joint areas were available for analysis. Scintigraphy correlated with swollen and tender joint scores at both timepoints. Specificity was highest with stringent scoring. Sensitivity was lowest for small joints with lower 111InCl3 uptake relative to background. A receiver operator curve (ROC), generated to analyze the diagnostic value of varying 111InCl3 scan stringency, demonstrated utilization of the most accurate portion of the ROC curve by the reader. 111InCl3 joint scintigraphy correlates with clinically detectable rheumatoid synovitis, supporting the hypothesis that transferrin receptor levels reflect rheumatoid disease activity.

24955759	Journal Article	The 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) combines scores on a 28-tender and swollen joint count (TJC28 and SJC28), a patient-reported measure for general health (GH), and an inflammatory marker (either the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or the C-reactive protein [CRP]) into a composite measure of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study examined the reliability of the DAS28 in patients with early RA using principles from generalizability theory and evaluated whether it could be increased by adjusting individual DAS28 component weights. Patients were drawn from the DREAM registry and classified into a \&quot;fast response\&quot; group (N = 466) and \&quot;slow response\&quot; group (N = 80), depending on their pace of reaching remission. Composite reliabilities of the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP were determined with the individual components\&#39; reliability, weights, variances, error variances, correlations and covariances. Weight optimization was performed by minimizing the error variance of the index. Composite reliabilities of 0.85 and 0.86 were found for the DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, respectively, and were approximately equal across patients groups. Component reliabilities, however, varied widely both within and between sub-groups, ranging from 0.614 for GH (\&quot;slow response\&quot; group) to 0.912 for ESR (\&quot;fast response\&quot; group). Weight optimization increased composite reliability even further. In the total and \&quot;fast response\&quot; groups, this was achieved mostly by decreasing the weight of the TJC28 and GH. In the \&quot;slow response\&quot; group, though, the weights of the TJC28 and SJC28 were increased, while those of the inflammatory markers and GH were substantially decreased. The DAS28-ESR and the DAS28-CRP are reliable instruments for assessing disease activity in early RA and reliability can be increased even further by adjusting component weights. Given the low reliability and weightings of the general health component across subgroups it is recommended to explore alternative patient-reported outcome measures for inclusion in the DAS28.

8006897	Journal Article	To review the outcome of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) diagnosed and treated with minimal intervention in community rheumatology practice. Forty-four ambulant patients with FMS, first seen in a 2-month period and treated with a simple management program, were identified and reviewed 2 years after diagnosis. A variety of clinical and psychological features were assessed using standard techniques. Forty-seven percent no longer fulfilled Smythe or ACR criteria for FMS. Remission was objectively identified in 24.2% of assessed patients. Significant differences in objective clinical signs, in symptoms, and in self-described disability were found between patients with and without FMS. Regular physical exercise, rather than drug or specific physical therapies, correlated highly with low FMS activity scores. Analysis of mood and coping strategies at the 2-year review showed low correlations with current FMS activity. Community FMS has a better prognosis than the literature suggests. Simple intervention may be associated with good outcome in a significant number of patients with FMS.

23716067	Journal Article	To assess which treatment strategy is most effective in inducing remission in early (rheumatoid) arthritis. 610 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA 2010 criteria) or undifferentiated arthritis (UA) started treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and a tapered high dose of prednisone. Patients in early remission (Disease Activity Score &lt;1.6 after 4 months) tapered prednisone to zero and those with persistent remission after 8 months, tapered and stopped MTX. Patients not in early remission were randomised to receive either MTX plus hydroxychloroquine plus sulfasalazine plus low-dose prednisone (arm 1) or to MTX plus adalimumab (ADA) (arm 2). If remission was present after 8 months both arms tapered to MTX monotherapy; if not, arm 1 changed to MTX plus ADA and arm 2 increased the dose of ADA. Remission rates and functional and radiological outcomes were compared between arms and between patients with RA and those with UA. 375/610 (61%) patients achieved early remission. After 1 year 68% of those were in remission and 32% in drug-free remission. Of the randomised patients, 25% in arm 1 and 41% in arm 2 achieved remission at year 1 (p&lt;0.01). Outcomes were comparable between patients with RA and those with UA. Initial MTX and prednisone resulted in early remission in 61% of patients with early (rheumatoid) arthritis. Of those, 68% were in remission and 32% were in drug-free remission after 1 year. In patients not in early remission, earlier introduction of ADA resulted in more remission at year 1 than first treating with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug combination therapy plus prednisone.

26887576	Comparative Study	Over the last decade aquatic exercise has become more and more popular. One of the latest trends is aqua-cycling, where participants sit on a water-resistant stationary bike and, while immersed chest deep in the water, combine continuous cycling with upper body exercises that utilise water resistance. Since stationary cycling and aquatic exercises are frequently recommended to patients with knee osteoarthritis, combining both would seem an obvious step, and an aqua-cycling exercise programme for patients with knee osteoarthritis has indeed been developed. This study protocol gives a detailed description of the exercise programme and the methodology of a study to compare this programme with treatment involving usual care only. The study is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial of Maastricht University Medical Centre+, the Netherlands. knee pain of four to seven on a 10-point pain rating scale; a Kellgren/Lawrence score between one to three; ability to cycle; good mental health; sufficient language skills; indication for physical therapy in conjunction with impairments due to OA. any contra-indication for aquatic exercise; planned total knee replacement; corticosteroid injection &lt;3 months and/or hyaluronic acid injection &lt;6 months; severe joint complaints (other than knee joint); symptomatic and radiological apparent hip OA; inflammatory joint diseases; inability to safely enter and exit the pool; fear of water. Participants will receive two 45-min moderate intense aqua-cycling sessions weekly over a period of 12 weeks in addition to usual care or usual care only. Usual care consists of an individual intervention plan comprising lifestyle recommendations, medication routine and referral to a physical therapist. Participants will be assessed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 weeks after baseline. The primary outcome is self-reported knee pain and physical functioning. Secondary outcomes are lower limb muscle strength, functional capacity, self-reported disease severity, physical activity level, quality of life, self-efficacy and fear of movement. Daily diaries will collect information on knee pain, physical functioning, level of physical activity, pain medication routine and physical therapy (control group only) or exercise participation over two 30-day periods (during the intervention period). To our knowledge the present study is the first randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of aqua-cycling in the pre-surgical stage of knee osteoarthritis. This trial will demonstrate if the newly designed aqua-cycling intervention, in supplement to usual care, can help to improve impairments due to knee osteoarthritis.

11865567	Case Reports	We present one case of Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (SS) secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with predominant psychiatric manifestations, treated with success by cyclophosphamide. From this case, we review the psychiatric aspects of these two autoimmune diseases as described in the literature and we present the etiopathogenic hypothesis and treatment of the psychiatric disorders. Case report--In August 1996, a 38 year old man was admitted in our psychiatric department for agitation. Primary SS had been diagnosed in July 1996. He had previously attempted to suicide but was never hospitalized in a psychiatric department. During the hospitalization in our department, the patient had auditive hallucinations and felt persecuted. He received loxapine 400 mg/day and was remitted in a few days. He was discharged to a convalescent home with the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. In October 1996, he was readmitted to our department for agitation. He had shown agitated behavior and aggression in the convalescent home. There were no hallucinations and no affective disorders. He became calm rapidly and was discharged home a few days later. In November 1996, he was found in a coma by a neighbor. He was admitted to an intensive care unit. The lumbar punction revealed blood cells. Cerebral computer tomography showed subarachnoid hemorrhage. The diagnosis was meningeal hemorrhage due to vasculitis. After regaining consciousness, the patient complained of reduced visual acuity. This was believed to be due to retrobulbar neuritis and the patient\&#39;s vision improved slightly with corticosteroids. The third hospitalization in our department occurred in February 1997 for depression. The patient had shut himself away for days in his apartment. He had suicidal ideas. His mood improved progressively under fluoxetine 40 mg/day. He was discharged to a convalescent home with the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. The fourth and last admission in our department occurred in June 1997. There were disturbances of memory and orientation. He felt sad and guilty about accusation of sexual abuse on his daughter. He presented typical histrionic symptoms: he had catatonic attitudes only in public areas such as the corridors. Cerebral computer tomography and electroencephalogram were normal. There was no biological abnormality. Signs of confusion rapidly disappeared. He felt better after reintroduction of fluoxetine 40 mg/day. Diagnosis was non-specified depressive disorder, but this episode could be retrospectively seen as delirium. After being hospitalized on these four occasions in one year in our psychiatric department, the diagnosis of his systemic disease was revised by rheumatologists. The patient was diagnosed as suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus associated with secondary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome. From September 1997, he received cyclophosphamide 2 g intraveinously per month during 6 months. His vision improved dramatically. His ocular dryness became milder. His mood is now stable. He has not suffered from hallucinations or delusion since. Psychiatric disorders in SLE--During the course of SLE, the occurrence of psychiatric manifestations varies widely from 5 to 83%. They include psychotic disorders, major depressive disorders, subtle cognitive disorders and personality disorders of histrionic type. Etiopathogenic hypothesis are: direct activity of the disease on the central nervous system by autoantibodies (antiphospholipide and antiribosome P autoantibodies) (18, 19) or cytokines (interleukin 2, interleukin 6, alpha interferon) (38, 59), side-effects of glucocorticosteroids and hydroxychloroquine (16) or anxious reaction to a chronic and potentially lethal illness (43, 54). Nevertheless, immunologic and cerebral imagery research suggests that psychiatric disorders are related to vasculitis and non-inflammatory vasculopathy of the small cerebral blood vessels. The management of the patients should include treatment of the disease itself and specific psychotropic treatment. Glucocorticosteroids and especially intravenous infusions of immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide, are effective. Psychotropic drugs must be used, making sure to avoid SLE-inducing drugs, like chlorpromazine, carbamazepine and lithium carbonate (19, 20, 45). In addition, psychologic care is essential. Psychiatric disorders in SS--During the course of the primary SS, the occurrence of psychiatric disorders is large as well: from 20 to 70% (47, 61, 62). They are mainly major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, cognitive disorders and dementia. Brief psychotic disorders and delirium are rare. Etiopathogenic hypotheses are similar as those in SLE, with some differences: antiphospholipide and antiribosome P autoantibodies are not usually found in SS and anti-Ro (SSA) autoantibodies in serum are associated with psychiatric disorders (3-11, 61). According to Drosos et al. (29, 30), psychiatric disorders are explained by psychological distress. This slowly progressive fluctuating disease creates constant discomfort from dysphagia, dyspareunia and functional disability. Some of these manifestations can be treated by corticosteroids and psychotropic drugs. Drugs with anticholinergic side-effects, like phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants and hydroxyzine which can enhance the oral dryness have to be avoided. Social and psychological support is important too. The diversity of psychiatric morbidity in SLE and SS may be due to differences in patient selection and a lack of uniform clinical criteria. Studies which use standardized diagnostic criteria and control groups don\&#39;t allow one to come to a conclusion about the relative prevalence of the psychiatric disorders in these autoimmune diseases. This will probably be resolved thanks to the recently published \&quot;American College of Rheumatology nomenclature and case definitions for neuropsychiatric lupus syndromes\&quot; (1). Finally, we can ask ourselves if there is a significant number of undiagnosed SLE and SS in psychiatric departments. Two studies report systematic search for SLE in psychiatric patients. In 1992, Hopkinson et al. (39) searched for several autoantibodies in serum samples of nearly 300 hospitalized psychiatric patients. In 1993, Van Dam et al. (65) did the same with more than 2,000 patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Hopkinson et al. found 1% undiagnosed SLE, which is much higher than in general population, and recommended to search SLE in every patient with a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate in psychiatric services. Results of the Van Dam et al. study suggest on the contrary, that SLE is not a common cause of admission to psychiatric hospitals. There is no study which report systematic search of Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome in a psychiatric department. This is probably because most of patients receive or have recently received psychotropics with anticholinergic side-effects which is an exclusion criteria of SS. Psychiatrists should keep in mind that SLE and primary SS are potential causes of psychiatric manifestations when examining patients with multiple unexplained somatic complaints and psychiatric symptoms. They should then search for autoantibodies in the serum after careful physical examination. Diagnosis of SLE or SS could lead to a better adapted prescription of corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs and specific psychotropic drugs, making sure to avoid lupus-inducing drugs in SLE and drugs with anticholinergic effects in SS. The existence of psychiatric manifestations in SLE and SS constitutes an indisputable clinical reality that each practitioner must be able to recognize and treat.

21044435	Journal Article	This paper reviews trials comparing the efficacy of MTX and biologic agents. So far, the clinical evaluations of 9 biologics have been published. Three TNF inhibitors - etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab - and the IL 6 receptor inhibitor tocilizumab have been investigated in MTX naïve patients using a parallel design. The trials had 3 treatment arms: monotherapies of MTX and of the biologic compound, and the combination of both. The other biologics - infliximab, certolizumab pegol, anakinra, rituximab, and abatacept - were investigated in patients who experienced inadequate response to MTX, and were treated with MTX + biologic agent versus MTX + placebo. That design does not provide a real comparison between MTX and the biologics but may indirectly give an indication of the relative efficacy of the different biologic agents. In all trials providing a head to head comparison, MTX and biologics were similarly effective as measured by ACR and EULAR response criteria including clinical remission. In general, improvement started earlier with biologic treatment than with MTX therapy. Inhibition of radiological progression was stronger with biologics probably since TNF inhibitors, in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, directly reduce osteoclast activity. The efficacy of biologics was significantly potentiated when they were combined with MTX. Based on the trial results the efficacy of MTX may be underestimated: the initial dose of MTX was too low and was increased only gradually. The trial design with ITT analysis and LOCF may have been disadvantageous for MTX since more patients treated with MTX withdrew and thereby had less time under treatment. Folic acid supplementation may have reduced the efficacy of MTX by interfering with its mechanism of action. Nonetheless, all trials confirmed a surprisingly good performance of MTX in comparison with biologics.

23354008	Journal Article	Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) play an important role in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of AGEs inhibitor (benfotiamine [50 mg]+pyridoxamine [50 mg]+methylcobalamin [500 µg]; Vonder [Cosme Farma Laboratories Limited, Goa, India]) in OA patients. A 24-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled study in primary OA patients (n=30 [F/M=26/4; mean age, 57.26±2.16 y]) meeting the classification criteria of American College of Rheumatology, was conducted. Inflammatory disease activity scores on the Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index, Lequesne Index, and Pain scores were analyzed. Biomarkers: serum nitrite, AGEs, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were also measured. Time taken to walk 20 m was also recorded. Patients were randomized to either AGEs inhibitor or placebo tablets as thrice-daily regimen. At 24 weeks, net decrease in pain score, -6.64±2.71 versus -8.20±1.28, P=0.003; total WOMAC score, -5.88±0.84 versus -8.26±1.24, P=0.013; Lequesne Index score, -0.60±0.06 versus -0.84±0.09, P=0.05; time taken for 20-m walk test, -5.0±1.39 versus -5.0±0.92 s, P=1.00, were observed in the placebo versus drug group, respectively. Net change in serum nitrite, -0.15±0.01 versus -0.79±0.12 µmol/L, P&lt;0.001; AGEs, -0.12±0.02 versus -0.99±0.09, arbitrary florescence units, P=0.001; thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, -0.69±0.12 versus -1.80±0.12 nmol/L, P&lt;0.01; C-reactive protein, -0.12±0.35 versus -2.45±0.60 mg/L, P&lt;0.01, were observed in the placebo versus drug group, respectively. This study shows the efficacy of an AGE inhibitor on decreasing pain and inflammation, and increasing daily activity and mobility in OA patients.

24986851	Comparative Study	To evaluate the association of synovitis, bone marrow edema (BME), and tenosynovitis in the progression of erosions quantified by hand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1 year in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in remission. A total of 56 of 196 patients with early RA in remission at 1 year and with available MRI data at baseline and at 12 months were included. MRI images were assessed according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring (RAMRIS) system. Persistent remission was defined as 28-joint Disease Activity Score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≤ 2.6 and/or Simplified Disease Activity Index ≤ 3.3 and/or the new boolean American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism remission criteria for a continuous period of at least 6 months. Progression of bone erosions was defined as an increase of 1 or more units in annual RAMRIS score for erosions compared to baseline. At 1 year, the majority of patients with RA in sustained remission showed some inflammatory activity on MRI (94.6% synovitis, 46.4% BME, and 58.9% tenosynovitis) and 19 of the 56 patients (33.9%) showed MRI progression of bone erosions. A significant difference was observed in MRI BME at 1 year, with higher mean score in patients with progression compared to nonprogression of erosions (4.8 ± 5.6 and 1.4 ± 2.6, p = 0.03). Subclinical inflammation was identified by MRI in 96.4% of patients with RA in sustained clinical remission. Significantly higher scores of BME after sustained remission were observed in patients with progression of erosions compared to patients with no progression. The persistence of higher scores of BME may explain the progression of bone erosions in patients with persistent clinical remission.

22076476	Clinical Trial	Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are widely prescribed for post-menopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer; however, musculoskeletal symptoms limit their tolerability. The purpose of this study was to determine whether joint pain in women receiving AIs is associated with inflammatory arthritis as measured by the disease activity score-28 (DAS-28), and to evaluate association with tenosynovitis on ultrasound. A total of 48 postmenopausal women with stage I-III breast cancer and hand pain were recruited from the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. Those receiving AIs were cases (n = 25), and those not receiving AIs were controls (n = 23). During a single study visit, subjects underwent blinded rheumatologic evaluation, DAS-28, health assessment questionnaires, autoantibodies, inflammatory markers, hand X-ray, and hand Duplex ultrasound. There were no significant differences between cases and controls in DAS-28, or inflammatory markers. A positive ANA (titer &gt; 1:160) was found in ten patients, four of whom met criteria for autoimmune disease (two with rheumatoid arthritis and two with Sjogren\&#39;s syndrome, equally distributed among cases and controls). This highlights the importance of considering underlying autoimmune disease in subjects with musculoskeletal complaints. Morning stiffness was more prolonged in women receiving AIs, but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). Ultrasound evidence of flexor tenosynovitis was common in both groups. Although tenosynovitis was not correlated with AI use (P = 0.26), there was a trend toward an association between tenosynovitis and morning stiffness (P = 0.089). While aromatase inhibitor-induced musculoskeletal symptoms (AIMSS) were more common in subjects receiving AIs, they were not unique to AI users. There was no association between presence of AIMSS features and other chemotherapy or medication exposures. Although the majority of subjects had been using AIs for more than 6 months, this study did not find evidence for inflammatory arthritis in women with hand pain receiving AIs. Further studies are needed to develop a case definition of AIMSS, and to confirm whether these symptoms are attributable to AI use.

8095422	Journal Article	The wide individual variations seen in all metabolic pathways which have been examined largely explain differences in drug dose response and toxicity. In some cases, distinct sub-sets occur where the enzyme activity is markedly different from that in the rest of the population (genetic polymorphism). Studies on isolated enzymes and use of restriction fragment length polymorphisms have in some cases helped to elucidate the relevant molecular biology. However, the lack of certain concordance between genotype and phenotype has shown that many questions remain unanswered. As more information becomes available at the molecular level, it may be easier to gain an understanding of the endogenous biochemistry which underlies the human condition. Either genotyping or phenotyping may then be used to predict potential drug side-effects or clinical outcomes.

11795993	Clinical Trial	To compare the clinical effects of laterally wedged insoles and neutrally wedged insoles (used as control) in patients with medial femoro-tibial knee osteoarthritis (OA). 6-month prospective randomized controlled study. outpatients with painful medial femoro-tibial knee OA. patient\&#39;s overall assessment of disease activity (5 grade scale), WOMAC index subscales and concomitant treatments. Performed as an intention-to-treat analysis. Main criterion: improvement in the patient\&#39;s assessment of activity (defined as a reduction of 1 grade or more at month 6 compared to baseline, and no intraarticular injection or lavage during the study). Secondary criteria for assessment: (a) improvement in the patient\&#39;s assessment of activity at months 1 and 3 compared to baseline, (b) improvement in the WOMAC subscales at months 1, 3 and 6, compared to baseline (defined as an improvement of at least 30%, and no intraarticular injection or lavage during the study) and (c) concomitant therapies (analgesics and NSAIDs). The baseline characteristics of the 156 recruited patients (41 males, 115 females, mean age 64.8 years) were not different in the two treatment groups. At months 1, 3 and 6 the percentages of patients with improvement in assessment of disease activity, in WOMAC pain, joint stiffness, and physical functioning subscales were similar in the two groups. The number of days with NSAIDs intake during the previous 3 months was decreased at month 6 compared with baseline in the group furnished with laterally wedged insoles (14.1 days+/-28 vs 9.9 days+/-27, P=0.04, Wilcoxon paired test), while it remained unchanged in the other group (15.5 days+/-24 vs 15+/-28, P=0.56). Compliance and tolerance were satisfactory. Compliance was different between the two groups at month 6, with a greater frequency of patients who wore insoles permanently in the laterally wedged insole group than in the other group (87.8% vs 74.3%;P=0.032). This study failed to demonstrate a relevant short-term symptomatic effect of laterally-wedged insoles in medial femoro-tibial OA. However, the decrease in NSAIDs consumption together with better compliance in the treated group are in favor of a beneficial effect of laterally-wedged insoles in medial femoro-tibial OA.

26384029	Journal Article	While efficacy of combination treatment with methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (\&#39;triple therapy\&#39;) has been shown in clinical trials, few studies have examined its longevity in a real-life setting. Our aim was to assess the tolerability, longevity and efficacy of a triple disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) regimen initiated in new-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Patients who met 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA with disease duration less than 2 years were offered triple therapy upon diagnosis. Treatment was intensified according to a response-driven step-up algorithm, which included progression to leflunomide (LEF) or a biologic agent. Of 181 new-onset RA patients, 119 commenced triple therapy. Median duration of triple therapy was 39 weeks, and 23.5% remained on it at last follow up, with median follow up 104 weeks. Continuous therapy with any three-DMARD combination (including LEF) occurred in 32% at last follow up, with median duration of 70 weeks. Cessation of at least one of MTX, SSZ or HCQ occurred because of an adverse event in 38%, remission in 7% and incomplete response in 28% of patients. SSZ accounted for 49% of initial drug withdrawals for an adverse event. Continuation of three-drug therapy did not significantly influence the proportion of patients achieving remission or low disease activity (LDA). Triple therapy in new-onset RA was reasonably well tolerated, persisting for median 39 weeks. SSZ intolerance commonly reduces longevity of triple therapy. Treating to the target of remission or LDA is more important than the number of DMARD continued.

22790578	English Abstract	Epidemic studies have shown that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients have shorter life expectancy than healthy persons, primarily due to cardiovascular events. The aim of our study was to explore inhibitory effects on atherosclerosis of RA patients by TNF-inhibitor etanercept (ETN). We studied six RA patients with moderate or high disease activity as defined by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease activity score (DAS28-ESR) in spite of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) 8 mg/week. We measured their pulse wave velocity (PWV) before and after treatment with ETN 25 mg/week for one year. There were no additional medications other than ETN that might influence on atherosclerosis. Their PWV decreased in five of six patients and the average decreased from 1474.8 cm/sec to 1432.5 cm/sec. The average of DAS28-ESR score was significantly decreased from 5.56 to 2.87 and they achieved good response by the EULAR criteria. There were no significant changes in the blood pressure, serum lipid (total cholesterol and triglyceride) and HbA1c ; all values were within normal limits before and after ETN treatment. It is suggested that the improvement of PWV is due to anti-inflammatory effects, leading inhibition of atherosclerosis, of ETN in RA patients.

6752878	Clinical Trial	This double-blind cooperative study comparing pirprofen and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was conducted in 12 centres and involved 342 patients distributed throughout the United States. The patients were randomized to either pirprofen 200 mg four times a day or ASA 900 mg four times a day. The drugs were administered for 52 weeks. Nine standard clinical criteria were used for assessment of the therapeutic results by the investigators and by the patients themselves. Fifty-five % of the total patient population reported that they were highly satisfied with pirprofen, as against 47% with ASA. The investigators preferred pirprofen in 51% of the cases and ASA in 38% (p less than 0.05). Side effects (tinnitus, gastrointestinal disorders) were more frequent in the ASA group than in the pirprofen group. During the 52-week treatment-period, biological alterations were only observed in two patients (1 on pirprofen, 1 on ASA).

12476750	English Abstract	Essential for evaluation of disease activity and functional disability in rheumatoid arthritis is to monitor the disease course by the outcome measures, which show quality of care i.e. efficacy of drugs, physical therapy and rehabilitation. To assess disease activity in 21 days hospital rehabilitation we chose Disease Activity Score (DAS). Functional disability was measured by Health Assessment Questionnary (HAQ). The measures were noted at arrival and admission and we found statistically significant decrease in values of DAS (t = 5,836; p &lt; 0.01) and HAQ (h = 16.26; p &lt; 0.05), but without clinically valid criteria for improvement. The conclusions are: these measures are not appropriate for assessment of efficacy for a short therm hospital rehabilitation, because DAS is measure which primary shows activity of inflammatory process, and HAQ as a long term measure is not sensitive enough for the assessment of short term rehabilitation.

20033813	Journal Article	To stop or not to stop immunosuppressive therapy in the perioperative setting puts the clinician to a challenge. The risk of potential wound infection with possible septic or even lethal consequences needs to be weighted against exacerbation of the rheumatic disease. However, exacerbation of autoimmune inflammatory activity needs to be treated with increasing immunosuppressive medication, thus leading to enhanced risk of local and systemic infection as well. Unfortunately, up to now there is no data from randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trials available on how to steer immunosuppressive therapy in the perioperative setting, making evidence-based recommendations difficult. Neither is there good evidence, if the risk of infectious complications under immunosuppressive therapy differs according to the type and localization of surgery performed. Finally, immunosuppressive co-medication, like glucocorticoid dosage, is not adequately addressed in the available studies, making interpretation of these studies even more problematic. Therefore, a decision has to be made on an individual basis. We discuss the available data on DMARD and biologics therapy in the perioperative setting and describe our own perioperative management with different DMARDs and biologics.

25150077	Clinical Trial	Evidences indicate that angiogenesis is an important process in the development of destructive synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, it has been shown that the polymorphism of the integrin-αv subunit encoded by the ITGAV gene plays a role in angiogenesis and is considered as RA susceptibility loci. This study investigated association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ITGAV with disease activity score (DAS28), serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide(anti-CCP) antibody in 419 RA patients and 398 healthy individuals. Four SNPs in ITGAV gene (rs3911238, rs3738919, rs10174098 and rs3768777) were analyzed. Serum concentrations of anti-CCP antibody and CRP were measured by ELISA. We used the EULAR activity criteria to calculate DAS28-CRP. Among these SNPs, the ITGAV-rs3911238-G/C polymorphism was associated with RA disease activity [remission-to-low and moderate-to-high in codominant model (CC vs.GG: OR=1.53, p=0.041 and allele (C vs. G: OR=1.18, p=0.042)] and presence of anti-CCP (codominant CC vs.GG: OR=2.77, p=0.001, allele C vs. G: OR=1.19,p=0.033). The carriers of CC genotype ITGAV-rs3911238 had higher serum levels of CRP and anti-CCP antibody titer and higher ESR and disease activity score than carriers of GG and CG genotypes. Furthermore, haplotypes analysis showed that ITGAV rs3733891C/rs3768777T/rs3911238C/rs10174098A and ITGAV rs3733891A/rs3768777T/rs3911238G/rs10174098A haplotypes increased severity and anti-CCP antibody in RA patients (OR=5.54, p=0.049 and OR=2.89; p=0.024, respectively) in comparison with ITGAV rs3733891C/rs3768777T/rs3911238G/rs10174098A haplotypes. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the link between systemic inflammatory markers and the ITGAV-rs3911238 polymorphism allele in Iranian RA patients.

26713415	Clinical Trial	In osteoarthritis (OA) clinical trials, a pain measure that is most sensitive to change is considered optimal. We compared sensitivity to change of patient-reported pain outcomes, including a patient-preference measure (where the patient nominates an activity that aggravates their pain). We used data from 2 trials of patients with confirmed (American College of Rheumatology criteria) knee OA: a trial of brace treatment for patellofemoral OA, and a trial of intraarticular steroids in knee OA. Both trials reported an improvement in pain following treatment. Participants rated pain on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS), in the activity that caused them the most knee pain (VASNA ), as well as completing questions on overall knee pain and the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were also calculated from the KOOS. Standardized changes in each outcome were generated between treatment and control after 6 weeks intervention in the BRACE trial, and 1-2 weeks following intervention in the steroid trial. The VASNA produced standardized changes following treatment that were at least as large as other pain outcomes. In the BRACE trial, the between-groups standardized change with the VASNA was -0.63, compared with the KOOS pain subscale change of -0.33, and pain in the last week VAS change of -0.56. In the steroid study, within-group change following treatment in the VASNA was -0.60, compared to the last week VAS change of -0.51, and KOOS pain subscale change of -0.58. Pain on nominated activity appears to be at least as, and in some cases more, sensitive to change than the KOOS/WOMAC questionnaire.

24612946	Journal Article	Primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (pSS) is one of the most frequent autoimmune systemic diseases, mainly characterized by ocular and oral dryness due to the progressive destruction of lachrymal and salivary glands by an inflammatory process. A noteworthy proportion of patients also features extraglandular manifestations, sometimes severe and life-threatening. Until now, its management relies mostly on symptomatic interventions, long-term monitoring, and, in patients with severe systemic complications, immunosuppressive drugs can be provided. However, recent years have seen great progresses in the understanding of the pathological processes of the disease. The central role of regulatory lymphocytes, the implication of the type 1 interferon pathway in some patients or the importance of epigenetics have been highlighted. New classification criteria have been recently published and have shed in light an international attempt for a better recognition of the patients, probably thanks to the development of new diagnostic procedures such as salivary gland ultrasonography. To facilitate the detection of treatment efficacy in clinical trials and to help in determining which subgroups of patients would have benefits from intensive therapies, a better definition of activity scores and the availability of new prognostic markers are urgent. Thereby, the development of future therapies should be based on specific molecular signatures that will enable a personalized management of each patient. This review focuses on the most striking advances in the fields of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of pSS, which generate a great hope for pSS patients.

26847392	Journal Article	Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors (anti-TNFs) are typically used when the inflammatory rheumatologic diseases ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-AxSpA) have not responded adequately to conventional therapy. Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends treatment with adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab in adults with active (severe) AS only if certain criteria are fulfilled but it does not recommend infliximab for AS. Anti-TNFs for patients with nr-AxSpA have not previously been appraised by NICE. To determine the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness within the NHS of adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab, within their licensed indications, for the treatment of severe active AS or severe nr-AxSpA (but with objective signs of inflammation). Systematic review and economic model. Fifteen databases were searched for relevant studies in July 2014. Clinical effectiveness data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were synthesised using Bayesian network meta-analysis methods. Results from other studies were summarised narratively. Only full economic evaluations that compared two or more options and considered both costs and consequences were included in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness studies. The differences in the approaches and assumptions used across the studies, and also those in the manufacturer\&#39;s submissions, were examined in order to explain any discrepancies in the findings and to identify key areas of uncertainty. A de novo decision model was developed with a generalised framework for evidence synthesis that pooled change in disease activity (BASDAI and BASDAI 50) and simultaneously synthesised information on function (BASFI) to determine the long-term quality-adjusted life-year and cost burden of the disease in the economic model. The decision model was developed in accordance with the NICE reference case. The model has a lifetime horizon (60 years) and considers costs from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services. Health effects were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. In total, 28 eligible RCTs were identified and 26 were placebo controlled (mostly up to 12 weeks); 17 extended into open-label active treatment-only phases. Most RCTs were judged to have a low risk of bias overall. In both AS and nr-AxSpA populations, anti-TNFs produced clinically important benefits to patients in terms of improving function and reducing disease activity; for AS, the relative risks for ASAS 40 ranged from 2.53 to 3.42. The efficacy estimates were consistently slightly smaller for nr-AxSpA than for AS. Statistical (and clinical) heterogeneity was more apparent in the nr-AxSpA analyses than in the AS analyses; both the reliability of the nr-AxSpA meta-analysis results and their true relevance to patients seen in clinical practice are questionable. In AS, anti-TNFs are approximately equally effective. Effectiveness appears to be maintained over time, with around 50% of patients still responding at 2 years. Evidence for an effect of anti-TNFs delaying disease progression was limited; results from ongoing long-term studies should help to clarify this issue. Sequential treatment with anti-TNFs can be worthwhile but the drug survival response rates and benefits are reduced with second and third anti-TNFs. The de novo model, which addressed many of the issues of earlier evaluations, generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from £19,240 to £66,529 depending on anti-TNF and modelling assumptions. In both AS and nr-AxSpA populations anti-TNFs are clinically effective, although more so in AS than in nr-AxSpA. Anti-TNFs may be an effective use of NHS resources depending on which assumptions are considered appropriate. Randomised trials are needed to identify the nr-AxSpA population who will benefit the most from anti-TNFs. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42014010182.

16142748	Clinical Trial	Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a proinflammatory, innate response cytokine that mediates pleiotropic effector function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inflammatory synovitis. Our objective was to study the ability of HuMax-IL15, a human IgG1 anti-IL-15 monoclonal antibody, to neutralize exogenous and endogenous IL-15 activity in vitro and to perform a phase I-II dose-escalation trial with HuMax-IL15 in patients with active RA. Mononuclear cells from blood and synovial fluid (SF) of RA patients were isolated and cultured in vitro under experimental conditions involving the addition of HuMax-IL15. HuMax-IL15 was administered to 30 RA patients who received no other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in a 12-week, dose-ascending, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase I-II proof-of-concept study. In vitro studies showed that HuMax-IL15 suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in an IL-15-dependent cell line, BDB2, and was capable of suppressing the release of interferon-gamma by synovial fluid mononuclear cell (SFMC) cultures induced by exogenous IL-15. Furthermore, HuMax-IL15 F(ab\&#39;)2 fragments suppressed exogenous IL-15-induced CD69 expression in RA peripheral blood mononuclear cells and SFMCs, which indicates that HuMax-IL15 can specifically neutralize several biologic effects of IL-15 in synovial tissue in vitro. In a phase I-II clinical trial, HuMax-IL15 was well tolerated clinically, with no significant effects on T lymphocyte subset and natural killer cell numbers. Substantial improvements in disease activity were observed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement (63% of patients), 50% improvement (38%), and 70% improvement (25%). These clinical data suggest for the first time that IL-15 could represent a novel therapeutic target in RA.

16496073	English Abstract	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common systemic inflammatory joint disease. It can be treated effectively with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, and the currently propagated treatment strategy is to treat RA consequently, and revise the therapeutic approach frequently on the basis of proper disease activity evaluation. In the current review, we focus on the instruments and measures used in the assessment of RA disease activity. We will first consider the so-called core set measures of activity, prividing comprehensive overviews on joint count scales, global scales, pain scales, biomarkers, and functional assessment instruments. The second part of the review focuses on the value of composite measures of disease activity; a term under which we subsume activity indices using various formulae, self-assessment tools of disease activity, and response criteria. Among the inflammatory rheumatic diseases, RA is the one for which the most intensive research is done, and usually instruments that work for RA are further tested for other joint diseases. However, there is still a research agenda for the assessment of disease activity, even for RA. One important aspect is to assess the reliability and utility of all available instruments, including the very low end of disease activity, since remission has become an achievable goal. Another focus of disease activity assessment is to derive measures that work in clinical trials and in daily practice, but are also well understood by patients and physicians. This will further improve our ability to care for patients with RA consequently.

16750873	Comparative Study	Adult-Onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare condition of unknown origin with various presentations and unpredictable outcome. The aim of this study was to analyse clinical and biological presentation, and outcome of patients admitted to an internal medicine service. A retrospective cohort design with prospective follow-up was used. All the patients admitted to our internal medicine service for AOSD between January 1998 and March 2004 were included. According to Yamaguchi\&#39;s classification criteria, 17 patients were analysed with a mean age at onset of 37.3 years and a 2.4 sex-ratio (female/male). Mean follow-up length was 52.1 months. Eight patients developed a monocyclic systemic form, 8 a polycyclic systemic form and 1 a chronic articular form. Arthralgia (87%) and arthritis (53%) were less frequent than in other series. Sixteen patients were treated: 14 by corticosteroids, 6 by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, 5 by methotrexate, 2 intravenous polyglobulin and one by anti-TNF drug. Patients with a corticodependant or corticoresistant form had more polyarthritis at the onset of the disease (3/6 vs 0/11, P=0.029). In internal medicine activity, AOSD without oligo- or polyarthritis may be more frequent than expected according to the literature. Corticotherapy alone is often efficient in these AOSD form without synovitis, and methotrexate use is uncommon.

16303102	Comparative Study	Interleukin-1 (IL-1), one of the major pro-inflammatory cytokines, plays an important role in the pathophysiology and progression of adult and pediatric arthritis. Inhibiting IL-1 activity by using a recombinant human IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) given alone or in combination with methotrexate, moderately reduced the signs and symptoms of active arthritis in adults and slowed the rate of radiographic destruction. Preliminary results from an open label portion of a trial in children with polyarticular arthritis show similar outcomes with 58% of children exhibiting clinical improvements based on the Juvenile Arthritis 30% Core Set Criteria. The drug has an overall favorable safety profile and injection-site reactions are the most commonly reported adverse event in both groups. However despite its rather disappointing effect in polyarticular arthritis, anakinra is being discovered as an effective treatment of systemic arthritis and children with mutations in the NALP3/CIAS1/PYPAF1 genes leading to autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as neonatal- onset multisystem inflammatory disease.

22753402	Journal Article	Early treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with combination treatment starting with methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone (FIN-RACo strategy) is superior to monotherapy. A study was undertaken to determine whether infliximab (INFL) added to intensified FIN-RACo treatment for the initial 6 months improves the 2-year outcome. 99 patients with early untreated active RA were enrolled in an investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, parallel-group trial. Primary outcomes were remission and radiological changes at 2 years. All patients started with FIN-RACo. In addition, they were randomised to receive INFL or placebo (Pla) from weeks 4 to 26. At 24 months, 66% and 53%, respectively, of the patients in the FIN-RACo+INFL and FIN-RACo+Pla groups were in remission according to the modified American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (p=0.19), 26% and 10% were in sustained modified ACR remission (p=0.042) and 82% in both groups were in remission by 28-joint disease activity score (not significant). Mean changes in the total Sharp-van der Heijde score were 0.2 and 1.4, respectively (p=0.0058). Most patients with early active RA achieve clinical remission and develop negligible joint damage with the intensified FIN-RACo regimen. Adding INFL for the first 6 months delays radiological progression.

12076505	Journal Article	Because of the unpredictability people with arthritis face on a daily basis, patient education programmes have become an effective complement to traditional medical treatment giving people with arthritis the strategies and the tools necessary to make daily decisions to cope with the disease. To assess the effectiveness of patient education interventions on health status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A selection of review articles (see references) were examined to identify further relevant publications. There was no language restriction. Randomised controlled trials (RCT\&#39;s) evaluating patient education interventions that included an instructional component and a non-intervention control group; pre- and post-test results available separately for RA, either in the publication or from the studies\&#39; authors; and study results presented in full, end-of-study report. Twenty-four studies with relevant data were included. We found significant effects of patient education at first follow-up for scores on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment and psychological status. Physician global assessment was not assessed in any of the included studies. The two separate dimensions of psychological status: anxiety and depression showed no significant effects, nor did the dimensions of pain and disease activity. At final follow up no significant effects of patient education were found. Patient education as provided in the studies reviewed here had moderate short-term effects on patient global assessment, and small short-term effects on disability, joint counts and psychological status. There were no long-term benefits.

25926287	Journal Article	There is a critical need for proven drugs other than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of degenerative joint disease (DJD) pain in dogs. Antibodies against nerve growth factor (NGF) are analgesic in rodent models and in humans with DJD. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel caninised anti-NGF antibody (NV-01) for the treatment of DJD pain in dogs. In a randomized, parallel group, stratified, double masked, placebo controlled, proof of principle clinical pilot study design, 26 dogs with DJD received NV-01 (200 mcg/kg IV) or placebo on day 0 (D0). In addition to objective accelerometry measures, owners completed clinical metrology instruments (Client-Specific Outcome Measures [CSOM], Canine Brief Pain Inventory [CBPI] and Liverpool Osteoarthritis in Dogs Index [LOAD]) on D0, D14 and D28. CBPI subscales (pain severity [PS] and pain interference [PI]), CSOM and LOAD scores were evaluated within and between groups for change over time. Recognized success/failure criteria were applied and success compared between groups. CBPI PS and PI scores significantly improved in the NV-01 group (PS: D0-14, P = 0.012 and D0-28, P = 0.019; PI: D0-14, P = 0.012 and D0-28, P = 0.032) but not in the placebo group. CSOM scores showed similar patterns with a significant difference between within-group changes at D14 and D28 (P = 0.038 and P = 0.009, respectively), and significantly more successes at D28 (P = 0.047). LOAD scores significantly improved in the NV-01 group (D0-14, P = 0.004 and D0-28, P = 0.002) but not in the placebo group. There were significant differences between the groups for change in LOAD score at D14 (P = 0.014) and D28 (P = 0.033). No side effects were noted. Activity in the NV-01 group increased over the study period compared to placebo (P = 0.063) and the difference between the groups for change in activity over the time period 9am-5pm (8 hours) was significant (P = 0.006). These pilot data demonstrate a positive analgesic effect of anti-NGF antibody in dogs suffering from chronic pain. The magnitude of the effect appeared identical to that expected with an NSAID.

16855169	Controlled Clinical Trial	Osteoporosis (OP) occurs more frequently in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) than in healthy individuals. Specific treatments of RA may increase susceptibility to OP, but at the same time decrease inflammatory activity, which is associated with accelerated bone loss. Treatment with TNF-alpha blockers might influence bone metabolism and prevent structural bone damage in RA, in particular at the periarticular level. Our aim was to assess the influence of anti-TNF-alpha therapy on bone metabolism in RA patients. To that end we evaluated a group of 30 RA patients [mean age 50.6 +/- 6.8 years; median disease duration 82 +/- 38 months; median disease activity score (DAS-28) 5.8 +/- 1.2: 70% of whom were positive for the rheumatoid factor IgM (&gt;40 IU/mL)]. Patients were treated with stable therapy of prednisone (7.5 mg/day) and methotrexate (MTX = 10 mg/week). Eleven of these RA patients further received etanercept (25 mg, twice/weekly) and 10 infliximab (3 mg/kg on 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter). A control group included 10 RA patients with stable therapy (prednisone and MTX) and without anti-TNF-alpha therapy. All the patients fulfilled the ACR criteria for the diagnosis of adult RA and were treated for 6 months. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) bone densitometry was performed at the metaphyses of the proximal phalanges of both hands with a DBM Sonic 1200 QUS device (IGEA, Carpi, Italy). Amplitude-dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) was evaluated at base line and at 3 and 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the hip and lumbar spine (L1-L4) was determined by a densitometer (GE Lunar Prodigy, USA) at base line at after 6 months. Soluble bone turnover markers [osteocalcin (BGP) and deoxypyridinoline/creatinine (Dpd/Cr) ratio] were measured in all patients at the same times, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. All data were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results were as follows: AD-SoS values were found increased by 1.3% after 6 months of treatment in the RA patients treated with anti-TNF-alpha therapy. On the contrary, the Ad-SoS levels decreased by 4.6% during the same period in the untreated RA group. BMD increased by 0.2% at lumbar spine and 0.1% at the hip in TNF-alpha-blocker-treated patients and decreased by 0.8% and 0.6% (at lumbar spine and at the hip, respectively) in RA patients without anti-TNF-alpha therapy. However, BMD variations were not significant. In RA patients treated with TNF-alpha blockers, BGP levels were found significantly increased (14.8 +/- 3.8 mg/mL vs. 22.4 +/- 4.2 mg/mL; P &lt; 0.01) and Dpd/Cr levels were found significantly decreased (8.2 +/- 2.1 nM vs. 4.6 +/- 1.8 nM; P &lt; 0.01) at 6 months when compared to base line values. On the contrary, there were no significant differences in the untreated RA patients concerning these latter parameters (BGP = 12.2 +/- 3.1 mg/mL vs. 10.8 +/- 2.8 mg/mL and Dpd/Cr = 8.9 +/- 2.4 nM vs. 10.2 +/- 1.8 nM, respectively). In conclusion, during 6 months of treatment of RA patients with TNF blockers, bone formation seems increased while bone resorption seems decreased. The reduced rate of OP appears to be supported by the same mechanisms involved in the decreased bone joint resorption during anti-TNF-alpha therapy, that is, the marked decrease of the proinflammatory (i.e., TNF-alpha) cytokine effects on bone metabolism.

15915323	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which interleukin (IL)-10 plays an important role. There are, however, controversial reports that IL-10 promoter polymorphism may be an independent marker of susceptibility and severity of RA. The aim of the present study was to examine the IL-10 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA. We examined 95 patients with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for analysis of the promoter polymorphism of the IL-10 gene. In RA patients, the prevalence of genotypes encoding high expression of IL-10 was observed. Nevertheless, there was no association between IL-10 genotypes and age at disease diagnosis, disease activity in a physician\&#39;s global assessment, and joint and extra-articular involvement. There was also no correlation between IL-10 polymorphism and disease activity parameters--erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, number of swollen and tender joints, and duration of morning stiffness. We suggest that IL-10 promoter polymorphism is not a genetic risk factor for RA activity.

25896337	Journal Article	Spondyloarthritides are a group of inflammatory rheumatological diseases that cause arthritis with a predilection for spinal or sacroiliac involvement in addition to a high association with HLA-B27. Juvenile spondyloarthritis is distinct from adult spondyloarthritis and manifests more frequently as peripheral arthritis and enthesitis. Consequently juvenile spondyloarthritis is often referred to as enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) subtype under the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) classification criteria. The American College of Rheumatology Treatment Recommendations for JIA, including ERA, are based on the following clinical parameters: current treatment, disease activity and the presence of poor prognostic features. The MRI features of juvenile spondyloarthritis include marrow edema, peri-enthesal soft-tissue swelling and edema, synovitis and joint or bursal fluid. Marrow edema is nonspecific and can be seen with other pathologies as well as in healthy subjects, and this is an important pitfall to consider. With further longitudinal study and validation, however, whole-body MRI with dedicated images of the more commonly affected areas such as the spine, sacroiliac joints, hips, knees, ankles and feet can serve as a more objective tool compared to clinical exam for early detection and monitoring of disease activity and ultimately direct therapeutic management.

Clinical and US assessments were performed on 44 joints, which were scored for grey-scale (GS) synovitis and Power Doppler (PD) signal. PD signal inside intra-articular synovium or tendon sheath was considered as inflammatory activity. Thirty-four patients were included, of whom 23 patients were labelled as ID on medication and 11 patients without medication. The duration of the current episode of ID at the inclusion time was 9.5 months. Although it was longer for the group off medication there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.06). Thirteen patients presented US findings. Number of US-detected synovial abnormalities was higher in patients on medication, but there were no significant differences between both groups in the detection of GS synovitis (p=0.86), GS tenosynovitis (p=0.78) and PD signal (p=0.38). Out of 37 joints presenting US-determined GS-synovitis, 18 joints showed PD signal. Our study provides evidence of synovitis and tenosynovitis on B-mode US in JIA patients with clinical inactivity. In addition, inflammatory activity upheld by power-Doppler has been shown in a few joints from patients on medication.

24005839	Journal Article	Adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology which commonly affects young adults. Treatment of AOSD patients includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and DMARDs. Interleukin (IL)-6 blockade is an attractive therapeutic option for AOSD because this cytokine contributes to the pathogenesis of major AOSD symptoms. Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody that blocks the effects of IL-6. Preliminary results of TCZ in AOSD have been promising. Here, we reported our experience evaluating both the safety and the efficacy of 12 months therapy with TCZ in 11 patients with AOSD refractory to corticosteroids and MTX therapy, followed for 18 months, including the first 12 months of active treatment and the last 6 months to evaluate the activity of the disease when the treatment was discontinued. The main outcome measures were the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria and improvement of systemic symptoms at the 3, 6, 12, and 18-months follow-up periods. Our patients rapidly responded and experienced a sustained clinical remission over time during active treatment. Disease Activity Score 28 decreased from 5.62 (3.75-8.28) [median (range)] at baseline to 1.61(0.49-3.5) at month 12. EULAR remission was achieved in 81.82 % at 12 months. Tender joint and swollen joint counts displayed a progressive reduction during active therapy study period. During treatment, we observed a resolution of fever in our AOSD patient. In conclusion, TCZ might represent a suitable option for the therapy of refractory AOSD patients.

21925451	English Abstract	Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a complex systemic joint inflammatory disease with differing manifestations and evolution. A valid, reliable and sensitive assessment procedure that is able to differentiate the inflammatory activity is essential in clinical practice, both in terms of reaching therapeutic decisions and assessing the response to treatment. The methods currently employed to assess the activity of RA are a combination of clinical parameters, laboratory tests and indicators of the progression of the disease, such as the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the Disease Activity Score (DAS) and the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI). The emergence of new and more effective therapies obliges us to be more demanding in our therapeutic objectives, and therefore to consider the suitability of the methods that we use to follow our patients\&#39; progress.

10493667	Clinical Trial	To evaluate miniarthroscopy (MA) (needle arthroscopy) of involved joints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the early detection and staging of synovitis and its application in visual guided synovial biopsies. 1.0 and 1.9 mm (0 degree/30 degrees) arthroscopes were used in a 2 portal technique. MA performance was developed and evaluated first on hand cadavers (n = 20) and then transferred to metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints under local anesthesia conditions. Joints of 20 patients with RA with different disease activity and duration were scoped and rated according to scores adapted from arthroscopy of other joints. In 20/20 cases MA provided visualizing and magnification of intraarticular features of MCP joints in RA and allowed grading of synovial alterations, chondromalacia, and bony alterations. Synovial surface changes, thickness, and fibrosis were related to disease duration, as was damage to cartilage and bone. The degree of acute inflammatory reactions like vascularity and hyperemia varied independently of chronic changes; synovial proliferation was reflected to some extent by C-reactive protein. In 2 patients with early RA, synovitis criteria were found macroscopically and histologically. In 18/20 joints, biopsies were taken under visual control; in the other 2, progression of disease (Larsen score &gt;3) limited arthroscopy to 1.0 scope imaging only. Sampling sizes were sufficient for histologic and molecular analysis.

27104003	Journal Article	In the past years, ultrasound imaging has become an integral element of the diagnostic process in rheumatic diseases. It enables the identification of a range of inflammatory changes in joint cavities, sheaths and bursae, and allows their activity to be assessed. In 2012, experts of the European Society of Musculoskeletal Radiology prepared recommendations concerning the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases. Ultrasound was considered the method of choice in imaging peripheral synovitis. Moreover, ultrasound imaging has been popularized thanks to the new classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis issued by the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism in 2010. They underline the role of ultrasound imaging in the detection of articular inflammatory changes that are difficult to assess unambiguously in the clinical examination. These criteria have become the basis for recommendations prepared by experts from the European League Against Rheumatism concerning medical imaging in rheumatoid arthritis. Nine of ten recommendations concern ultrasonography which is relevant in detecting diseases, predicting their progression and treatment response, monitoring disease activity and identifying remission. In the new criteria concerning polymyalgia rheumatica from 2012, an ultrasound scan of the shoulder and pelvic girdle was considered an alternative to clinical assessment. Moreover, the relevance of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and monitoring of peripheral spondyloarthropathies was widely discussed in 2014 during the meeting of the European League Against Rheumatism in Paris.

26653716	Journal Article	Vascular health is of concern in patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) since Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) epidemiologically has a well-described association with premature development of atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation with persisting systemic circulating inflammatory proteins may be a cause of vascular damage, but general physical inactivity could be an important contributor. Pain and fatigue are common complaints in patients with JIA and may well lead to an inactive sedentary lifestyle. For this reason we assessed the physical activity (PA) objectively in patients with moderate to severe Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) in comparison with gender and age matched healthy schoolchildren, and looked for associations between PA and features of JIA. One hundred thirty-three patients, 7-20 years of age, participated. Disease activity, disability, functional ability, and pain were assessed and PA was measured by accelerometry through 7 days and compared to PA in age- and gender-matched healthy schoolchildren. We found a significantly lower level of PA in patients compared to gender- and age-matched healthy schoolchildren both in average activity (counts per minute, cpm) (475.6 vs. 522.7, p = 0.0000018) and in minutes per day spent with cpm &gt;1500 (67.9 vs. 76.4, p = 0.0000014), with cpm &gt;2000 (moderate physical activity) (48.4 vs. 52.8, p = 0.0001, and with cpm &gt;3000 (high physical activity) (24.7 vs. 26.5, p = 0.00015). A negative association (β = -0.213, p = 0.014) between active disease in weight bearing joints and high physical activity remained the only significant association between disease related factors and PA. Of the girls 19% and of the boys 45% (vs. 39% and 61% in the reference group) met standards set by Danish Health Authorities for daily PA in childhood. Children and adolescents with JIA are less physically active than their healthy peers and less active than recommended for general health by the Danish Health Authorities. This is not explained by pain or objective signs of inflammation. When inflammation has been curbed, restoration of an active healthy lifestyle should be highly prioritized.

6857416	Journal Article	This study was undertaken to investigate the antirheumatic activity of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug benoxaprofen. Ten patients with definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before beginning drug therapy, using standard clinical criteria and serological tests of disease activity. These tests were repeated monthly during treatment with benoxaprofen for a period of 6 months. The results showed that benoxaprofen improved clinical parameters of disease activity, including morning stiffness, walking time, tenderness and swelling of joints and pain rating, in 7 of the 10 patients studied. One patient\&#39;s condition remained unchanged and 2 deteriorated during the trial period. In the group of 7 patients who showed clinical improvement there were significant reductions in serum levels of rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, alpha 1-antitrypsin, IgA, IgM and IgE, as well as in erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Five of the 10 patients, all of whom were initially seropositive for rheumatoid factor, became seronegative at the end of the trial and 5 of 6 with raised C-reactive protein levels registered undetectable levels. Although this trial was uncontrolled, these findings indicate that benoxaprofen has antirheumatic properties.

21651807	Journal Article	Disease remission has become a feasible goal for most rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients; however, patient-reported symptoms, such as pain, may persist despite remission. We assessed the prevalence of pain in RA patients in remission according to the Disease Activity Score (DAS28-CRP4) and the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) remission criteria. Data were analyzed from RA patients in the Brigham Rheumatoid Arthritis Sequential Study with data at baseline and 1 year. DAS28 remission was defined as DAS28-CRP4 &lt;2.6. The ACR/EULAR remission criteria included (a) one or more swollen joints, (b) one or more tender joints, (c) C-reactive protein ≤1 mg/dl, and (d) patient global assessment score ≤1. Pain severity was measured by using the pain score from the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ). The associations between baseline clinical predictors and MDHAQ pain at baseline and 1 year were assessed by using multivariable linear regression. Among the 865 patients with data at baseline and 1 year, 157 (18.2%) met DAS28-CRP4 remission criteria at both time points. Thirty-seven (4.3%) met the ACR/EULAR remission criteria at baseline and 1 year. The prevalence of clinically significant pain (MDHAQ pain ≥4) at baseline ranged from 11.9% among patients meeting DAS28-CRP4 remission criteria to none among patients meeting ACR/EULAR remission criteria. Patient global assessment, MDHAQ function, MDHAQ fatigue, MDHAQ sleep, and arthritis self-efficacy were significantly associated with MDHAQ pain in cross-sectional (P ≤ 0.0005) and longitudinal analyses (P ≤ 0.03). Low swollen-joint counts were associated with high MDHAQ pain in longitudinal analyses (P = 0.02) but not cross-sectional analyses. Other measures of inflammatory disease activity and joint damage were not significantly associated with MDHAQ pain at baseline or at 1 year. Clinically significant pain continues among a substantial proportion of patients in DAS28 remission but not among those in ACR/EULAR remission. Among patients in DAS28 remission, patient global assessment, disability, fatigue, sleep problems, and self-efficacy are strongly associated with pain severity at baseline and 1 year, whereas inflammatory disease activity and joint damage are not significantly associated with elevated pain severity at either baseline or 1 year.

17977485	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune and progressive disease. In patients with RA, persistent disease activity ultimately results in irreversible radiographic damage of the joints with persistent functional loss as a consequence. Disease activity measures assess a disease state at a particular time point. In order to evaluate the course of the disease in daily clinical practice or to judge the efficacy of a treatment in a clinical trial, a measure should also comprise the dimension of time. Composite indices provide a comprehensive view of disease activity and include the Disease Activity Score 28, the American College of Rheumatology criteria and newer indices such as the Clinical Disease Activity Index, the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index, and the Simplified Disease Activity Index. The target of RA treatment is to suppress disease activity as completely as possible, with remission being the ultimate goal. The composite index chosen should, therefore, be applicable to the circumstance in which it will be used, with different requirements in clinical practice versus clinical trials. In addition to the choice of an assessment index, novel disease monitoring strategies have been used to optimize treatment and disease control, as in the TICORA and BeST studies. It is clear that the best benefit for the patient can be obtained by combining the optimal treatment strategy and the most appropriate outcome measure. Low disease activity, intensive monitoring, and rapid adjustments in treatment seem to promise the greatest benefit. Further studies are required to better evaluate the clinical relevance of methods for assessing disease activity in patients with RA.

19627743	Comparative Study	Obesity has become a major public health problem in all western countries, and its prevalence is increasing. This condition is associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary heart disease; furthermore, obesity is a risk factor for mortality. To study the association of some prevalent diseases (diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, obesity, hypertension, inflammatory rheumatic disease, urolithiasis), the distribution of some lifestyle factors (tobacco, alcohol and caffeine consumption and physical activity during leisure time) and the prevalence of poverty in a population of postmenopausal women in the Canary Islands with obesity class II or III (BMI&gt;35). A personal interview was performed in all patients. A questionnaire was administered to assess their lifestyles and current medication use. The women\&#39;s medical records were reviewed to confirm the existence of certain diseases. A complete physical examination was performed in all patients. Weight and height were measured with the patient dressed in light clothing. Blood samples were obtained with the patient in a fasting state for subsequent analysis. Poverty was defined according to the criteria of the Spanish National Institute of Statistics. Women with obesity class II or III were older (56.8+/-11 vs 53.9+/-11.6 years, p=0.02), shorter (153.7+/-6.3 vs 156.9+/-36.1 cm, p=0.001), heavier (89.6+/-9.3 vs 66.6+/-10.4 kg, p=0.001) and had a greater body surface than controls (1.73+/-0.13 vs 1.54+/-0.13 m2, p=0.001). Alcohol and tobacco consumption were lower in obese women than in controls. Obese women drank more coffee and took less physical activity during leisure time than controls. The prevalence of hypertension -36% vs 17.9%, p=0.001, odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (IC)]=2.57 (1.56-4.24)-, diabetes mellitus -24.4% vs 11.3%, p=0.001, OR=2.52 (1.47-1.05)-and hypothyroidism -14.3% vs 8%, p=0.04; OR=1.91 (0.99-3.68)-was higher in obese women than in controls. More than half lived in rural areas and were below the poverty threshold. More than half of postmenopausal women with obesity class II or III were below the poverty threshold and lived in a rural area. In these women there was a lower consumption of alcohol and tobacco, lesser physical activity during leisure time, and a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism than in control postmenopausal women.

9201311	Comparative Study	The aim of the present study was to analyse possible differences in immunological features between patients with primary and secondary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (SS). Ten patients with primary SS and 10 patients with secondary SS also suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, were identified according to established criteria for SS. Ten healthy, age-matched women served as controls. The authors analysed the phenotypic characteristics of lymphocytes in peripheral blood as well as in focal inflammatory infiltrates of minor salivary gland biopsies. Functional analyses of T lymphocytes were performed after stimulation with mitogens and antigen. B cell activity was determined at the single cell level by spontaneous and mitogen induced immunoglobulin production. Serum levels of IL-4, IL-6 and IFN-gamma were also analysed. Patients with primary SS displayed a significantly higher degree of salivary gland inflammation and reduced salivary flow than did patients with secondary SS. Decreased in vitro T cell responses to antigen and mitogens were evident in both patient groups. The CD4/CD8 ratios in both peripheral blood and salivary gland lesions were significantly lower in primary SS compared with secondary SS patients. Polyclonal B cell activation, measured as the frequency of spontaneous immunoglobulin producing cells, was most prominent in primary SS, whereas a diminished response to poke-weed mitogen (PWM), a T cell dependent B cell mitogen, was more pronounced in secondary SS. The results reveal certain immunological aberrations in the whole group of patients with SS. In addition, the authors demonstrated distinct differences in immune dysfunction between patients with primary and secondary SS, indicating that they may constitute separate entities.

25034081	Journal Article	The approval of etanercept for the treatment of the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) categories extended oligoarthritis (ExtOA), enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) and psoriasis arthritis (PsA) was recently added to the approval for the treatment of polyarticular-course JIA (PA). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept in a large number of patients with the additional JIA categories. The Biologika in der Kinderrheumatologie (BIKER) registry documents baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and disease activity parameters. Efficacy was determined using the PedACR 30/50/70 response criteria and the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-10. Safety assessments were based on adverse events\&#39; reports. Until December 2012, a total of 1,678 JIA patients, incorporating 238 ERA, 315 ExtOA and 127 PsA patients were included. JADAS-10 demonstrated marked improvement compared to baseline after 3 to 24 months in ExtOA [16.1 ± 7.6 (baseline), 5.1 ± 5.2 (3 months), 3.0 ± 3.5 (24 months)]; ERA (15.3 ± 7.2, 4.4 ± 4.7, 4.0 ± 4.9) and PsA (14.7 ± 6.4, 5.0 ± 4.6, 5.3 ± 6.4). Compared to patients with PA, the rate of serious adverse events [relative risk (RR) 1.39 (0.95-2.03, p = 0.08)] and nonserious [1.18 (1.02-1.35; p = 0.03)] adverse events were elevated. The rate of uveitis flares was significantly higher in PsA (3.3/100 patient-years), ExtOA (2.8/100 patient-years) and ERA (2.7/100 patient-years) than in rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular JIA (1.3/100 pat.yrs) or RF-positive polyarticular JIA (0.27/100 patient-years). Reports on chronic inflammatory bowel disease were numerically more frequent in ExtOA, ERA and PsA. Administration of etanercept in patients with the JIA categories ExtOA, ERA and PsA is safe and very efficacious in children. Attention should be paid to the occurrence of extraarticular autoimmunopathies.

29986752	Case Reports	Adult onset Still\&#39;s disease is a systemic auto-inflammatory condition of unknown etiology characterized by intermittent spiking high fever, an evanescent salmon-pink or erythematous maculopapular skin rash, arthralgia or arthritis, and leukocytosis. Recently, a high level of interleukin-18 has been reported as a new characteristic marker. On the other hand no reports have been published on high interleukin-18 as a marker in older patients. We report a case of adult onset Still\&#39;s disease in an older patient successfully treated with steroids in which interleukin-18 was a useful marker of disease activity. A 66-year-old Asian woman presented to our hospital with fever and arthralgia. We diagnosed adult onset Still\&#39;s disease based on Yamaguchi criteria and a history of a high spiking fever, salmon-colored rash, and bilateral pain to shoulders, knees, and wrists. In this case, a high serum level of interleukin-18 was a diagnostic parameter. Administration of 40 mg of prednisolone followed by subcutaneous administration of 200 mg cyclosporine daily resulted in a dramatic resolution of our patient\&#39;s febrile episodes 2 months after admission. Prednisolone was tapered to 5 mg/day every 2 weeks and cyclosporine 200 mg/day was continued. Her serum interleukin-18 level was prominently decreased, and she was discharged 3 months after treatment. Serum interleukin-18 level may be a good diagnostic biomarker to monitor adult onset Still\&#39;s disease activity in older patients, measuring levels in both the acute and convalescent phases.

28914373	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which probiotics appears to have an immune modulating action along with decreased inflammatory process. Therefore, we aim to investigate the efficacy of probiotics as an adjuvant therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. A comprehensive literature search was performed using nine databases including PubMed and Web of Science. Interesting data was extracted and meta-analyzed. We assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane Collaboration\&#39;s tool. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD 42016036769). We found nine studies involving 361 patients who met our eligibility criteria. Our meta-analysis indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was significantly lower in the probiotics compared with the placebo group (standardized mean difference = - 0.708; 95% confidence interval (CI) - 1.370 to 0.047, P = 0.036). However, there was no difference between probiotics and placebo in disease activity score (mean difference 0.023; 95% CI - 0.584 to 0.631, P = 0.940). Probiotics lowered pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 in RA; however, its clinical effect is still unclear. Hence, many high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still needed to prove this effect.

21029564	Clinical Trial	To investigate the prevalence and severity of sonographic-detected abnormalities in knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to correlate ultrasound (US) findings with clinical data. Outpatients with chronic, painful knee OA according to the ACR criteria were consecutively recruited and underwent clinical and US examinations. An expert rheumatologist recorded the presence of knee joint pain, swelling and tenderness, patient\&#39;s global assessment of knee pain using visual analogue scale (VAS), and Lequesne Index of severity for knee OA. A second rheumatologist, blinded to the clinical data, performed the knee US examination using a Logiq9 machine equipped with a 12MHz linear probe and registering the presence of joint effusion, synovial proliferation, power Doppler (PD) signal, Baker\&#39;s cyst, osteophytes and femoral cartilage abnormalities. One hundred and sixty-four knees of 82 patients (53 women, 29 men) were studied; mean age was 63.2±8.1 SD years, mean disease duration was 4.3±5.6 SD years. All patients complained of at least one knee joint pain during physical activity. Mean patient\&#39;s VAS for knee pain was 48.4±19.9 SD mm, mean Lequesne Index was 8.2±4.4 SD. Knee swelling was present in 39% of the patients and tenderness was found in 65.8%. US showed: joint effusion in 43.3% of the patients, synovial proliferation in 22.1%, PD signal in 2.9%, Baker\&#39;s cysts in 6.6%, cartilage abnormalities in 79%, osteophytes in 100%. In all patients US findings were present at least at the level of one knee. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between a composite inflammatory score and both VAS (p=0.004) and Lequesne Index (p&lt;0.0001). This US study showed both inflammatory abnormalities and structural damage lesions in knee OA. Interestingly, statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between US inflammatory findings and the main clinical tests for OA, confirming that sonography has a relevant role in the global evaluation of patients with knee OA.

25593235	Journal Article	To assess the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) and to study the association of COPD with cigarette smoking, radiographic features, respiratory symptoms, disease activity, and laboratory inflammatory and serological features in patients with pSS. Fifty-one consecutive patients with pSS (mean age 60 yrs, range 29-82 yrs, 49 women) were assessed by pulmonary function tests (PFT). The PFT results were compared with previously studied population-based controls, standardizing results with regard to sex, age, height, weight, and cigarette smoking. In addition, patients with pSS were assessed by computed tomography of the chest, the European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren Syndrome Disease Activity Index and Patient Reported Index, the St. George\&#39;s Respiratory Questionnaire (which evaluates respiratory symptoms), and by laboratory inflammatory and serological tests. Forty-one percent of all patients with pSS and 30% of the never-smoking patients with pSS fulfilled the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for COPD. Vital capacity (VC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1/VC ratio, and DLCO were significantly decreased while residual volume (RV) and the RV/total lung capacity ratio were significantly increased in patients with pSS. Moderate correlations between PFT results, symptoms, and disease activity were found. However, laboratory inflammatory and serological features were poorly associated with PFT results in patients with pSS. COPD was a common finding in patients with pSS, even among never-smoking patients. An obstructive pattern was the predominant PFT finding in patients with pSS, although a superimposed restrictive lung disease could not be excluded. The results suggest that the disease per se is involved in the development of COPD in pSS.

16532146	Comparative Study	Nailfold capillaroscopy is an important tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with rheumatic diseases, in particular dermatomyositis and scleroderma. A relationship has been observed in adults between improved capillaroscopic findings and reduced disease activity. Our aim was to correlate disease activity (clinical and laboratory data) and nailfold capillaroscopy findings in 18 patients with inflammatory myopathies. This prospective study included 13 juvenile dermatomyositis patients (Bohan and Peter criteria) (mean age of 8.8 years) and five patients with overlap syndrome (mean age of 15.7 years). We evaluated disease activity (skin abnormalities and muscle weakness, muscle enzymes and acute phase reactants) and its correlation with nailfold capillaroscopy findings (dilatation of isolated loops, dropout of surrounding vessels and giant capillary loops). We used a microscope with special light and magnification of 10 to 16X. Eighteen patients underwent a total of 26 capillaroscopic examinations, seven of them on two or more occasions (13 were performed during the active disease phase and 13 during remission). Twelve of the 13 examinations performed during the active phase exhibited scleroderma pattern and 8 of the 13 examinations performed during remission were normal. Therefore, in 20 of the 26 examinations clinical and laboratory data and nailfold capillaroscopy findings correlated (p = 0.01). Nailfold capillaroscopy is a non-invasive examination that offers satisfactory correlation with disease activity and could be a useful tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory myopathies.

25968957	Journal Article	Currently, in the field of rheumatology, there is much attention given towards the possible causality between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), specifically regarding the role of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg). This bacterium is unique, having a citrullinating enzyme. Antibodies against citrullinated proteins are rather specific for RA. Because causality is ultimately tested in longitudinal cohort studies which currently do not exist for periodontitis and RA, this commentary applied Bradford Hill criteria on the existing literature to assess causality as the most likely interpretation of this association. From an epidemiologic point of view, patients with RA have a higher incidence of periodontal disease than individuals without RA. In addition, there is a dose-response pattern in the association between the severity of periodontitis and RA disease activity. There are indications that periodontitis precedes RA, but there is no evidence yet available to show that Pg plays a direct role in this temporal relationship. The role of the unique characteristic of citrullination by Pg remains unexplained. However, in animal models, citrullination by Pg plays a distinct role in the development and aggravation of experimental arthritis. Although the role of Pg in RA remains speculative, a causative role for periodontitis as a chronic inflammatory disease caused by infectious agents in RA seems biologically plausible.

18257609	Journal Article	Adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare, systemic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by daily high spiking fevers, evanescent rash and arthritis. Our objective was to review the most recent medical literature regarding advances in the understanding of disease pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment. There is no single diagnostic test for AOSD, and diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and usually necessitates the exclusion of infectious, neoplastic and autoimmune diseases. Laboratory tests are nonspecific and reflect heightened immunological activity with leukocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants and, in particular, extremely elevated serum ferritin levels. Abnormal serum liver function tests are common, while rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies are usually absent. Recent studies of the pathogenesis of the disease have suggested an important role for cytokines. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-18, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are all elevated in patients with AOSD. Prognosis depends on the course of the disease and tends to be more favourable when systemic symptoms predominate. Treatment includes the use of corticosteroids, often in combination with immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate, gold, azathioprine, leflunomide, tacrolimus, ciclosporin and cyclophosphamide) and intravenous immunoglobulin. Biological agents (e.g. anti-TNFalpha, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6) have been successfully used in refractory cases. Further progress has been hampered by the rarity and heterogeneity of the disease, which has not permitted the execution of randomized controlled studies.

11327243	Journal Article	A prospective clinical study of patients with recent onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to examine the relationship between inflammatory disease activity and joint destruction in a 4 year followup, and to evaluate prognostic markers for severe joint erosions early in the disease. Eighty-seven patients with RA according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria and a disease duration &lt; 2 years were followed for an observation time of 2 to 4 years (mean 3.1 yrs). Variables of clinical and laboratory disease activity were monitored, and HLA-DRB1 alleles were determined. Hand and foot radiographs were taken every 6 months. Multivariate analysis of independent contributions of covariates to progression of joint destruction resulted in a mixed effect regression model with significant influences for the presence of a shared epitope (SE) positive DR4 allele (SE+ DR4+; p = 0.007), rheumatoid factor (RF) IgA (p = 0.01), and sex (p = 0.059), but not for clinical variables or acute phase reactants. The odds ratio to reach a Larsen score above 32 during the observation period of 4 years was increased in patients positive for RF IgM (OR 2.7, p = 0.019), for the shared epitope on a DR4 allele (OR 8.6, p &lt; 0.005), and in patients with erosions already at study entry (OR 11.9, p = 0.001). The highest sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of severe bone destruction (84% and 79%) were found when the presence of either a SE+ DR4 allele or of early erosions was used as a prognostic marker (OR 20.4, p &lt; 0.0001). Our results show the pace of joint destruction in RA to be influenced by the presence of SE+ DR4 alleles, RF production, and sex and by the presence of erosive disease at presentation. Those prognostic markers exert their influence independently from the inflammatory disease activity.

9636949	Journal Article	To define the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis in a hospital-based population in Congo-Brazzaville. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the 36 subjects seen on an inpatient or outpatient basis at our rheumatology department who met American College of Rheumatology criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. There were 28 women and eight men (male to female ratio, 0.28), with a mean age of 43.5 years. The total number of patients seen at our department during the study period was 3518, yielding a prevalence of 1% for rheumatoid arthritis. Seven per cent of the patients with inflammatory joint disease had rheumatoid arthritis. Mean disease duration was 9.5 years (range, 1-25 years). The onset was gradual in every case and distal joints were affected first in 33 patients. All the patients but one had bilateral symmetric polyarthritis; affected joints included the proximal interphalangeal joints (n: 33), the metacarpophalangeal joints (n: 27), the wrists (n: 27), the metatarsophalangeal joints (n: 20), the knees (n: 26), the elbows (n: 18), the hips (n: 4), the temporomandibular joints (n: 4), and the cervical spine (n: 5). Boutonnière deformity of the fingers was the most common joint deformity (n: 15), followed by ulnar drift (n: 9). Three patients had tenosynovitis, two had tendon rupture, one had carpal tunnel syndrome and one had rheumatoid nodules. Rheumatoid factors were found in 70% of cases. Evidence of chondrolysis was seen on roentgenograms in every case. Gold and chloroquine were the two most commonly used second-line agents. Seven patients were on prednisone, in a mean daily dose of 6 mg. Mean follow-up was 15 months (range: 3-36 months). Steinbrocker\&#39;s disease activity stage was IV in 14 patients and III in eight patients; Steinbrocker\&#39;s functional stage was IV in five patients and III in three. The features and outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis in Congo-Brazzaville match textbook descriptions except for a lower prevalence of extraarticular manifestations. Similar findings have been reported for East Africa, South Africa, and some countries of West Africa.	NA	Revue du rhumatisme (English ed.)	4.Bronze	Rheumatoid arthritis in Congo-Brazzaville.

19229765	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease with a strong genetic contribution to its pathogenesis. Proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the inflammatory process in RA patients. The synthesis of cytokines is genetically determined. Cytokine gene polymorphisms have been implicated in a number of diseases, including RA. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of RA. There are, however, controversial reports that the IL18 promoter polymorphism may be an independent marker of RA susceptibility. The aim of the present study was to examine the IL18 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA in association with disease susceptibility and activity. We examined 404 patients with RA diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods were used to analyse the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1946518, rs187238, rs360718, rs360722, rs360721, rs549908, and rs5744292 in the promoter region of the IL18 gene. There were no significant differences in the distributions of the genotypes and haplotypes between RA patients and a control group. Age at RA diagnosis was lower in carriers of the rs1946518 CC and rs187238 GG genotypes. Erosive disease was diagnosed more frequently in patients with the rs1946518 CC and AC genotypes than in AA homozygotes. These results show that these polymorphisms in the IL18 gene are associated only with some disease parameters and are generally not factors significantly influencing the course of RA.

22258995	Journal Article	Even with optimal disease-modifying treatment and good control of disease activity, persistent pain due to structural damage is common in people with inflammatory arthritis and therefore additional treatment for pain might be required. Because comorbidity is highly prevalent in people with inflammatory arthritis, it is important to consider comorbidities such as gastrointestinal or liver diseases in deciding upon optimal pharmacologic pain therapy. To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological pain treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis who have gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities, or both. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL for studies to June 2010. We also searched the 2007-2010 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a hand search of reference lists of articles. All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) were considered for inclusion for assessment of efficacy. For safety we also considered single arm trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, cohort and case-control studies, and case series of 10 or more consecutive cases. Pain therapy comprised paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs (tramadol) and neuromodulators (anti-depressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants). The study population comprised adults (&gt;18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis who had gastrointestinal and/or hepatic comorbid conditions. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function and quality of life. Studies that included a mixed population of inflammatory arthritis and other conditions were included only if results for inflammatory arthritis were reported separately. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Out of 2869 articles only one single arm open trial was identified that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. This trial assessed the safety and efficacy of naproxen (dosage not specified) in 58 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal comorbidities for up to 52 weeks. Thirteen participants (22%) remained on gold therapy, four participants (10%) remained on hydroxychloroquine, 27 (47%) remained on corticosteroids, 12 (21%) remained on salicylates and all participants continued on antacids and bland diet. The presence of faecal occult blood was reported in 1/58 participants tested between weeks 1 to 26 and 2/32 participants tested between weeks 27 to 52. Over the course of the study, seven participants (12.1%) withdrew due to adverse events but of these, only two participants withdrew due to gastrointestinal side effects (abdominal pain n=1, nausea n=1) and no serious adverse events were reported. Noteable, out of 14 studies excluded due to inclusion of mixed population (osteoarthritis or other rheumatic conditions) or intervention already withdrawn, five trials reported higher risk of developing gastrointestinal events in patients with prior gastrointestinal events when treated with NSAIDs. On the basis of the current review, there is scant evidence to guide clinicians about how gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities should influence the choice of pain treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondylarthritis. Based upon additional studies that included a mixed population of participants with a range of rheumatic conditions, NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory arthritis and a history of gastrointestinaI comorbidity as there is consistent evidence that they may be at increased risk.

24986850	Comparative Study	To examine the pattern of disease severity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at presentation to the Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR) over 20 years. NOAR is a primary-care-based cohort of patients with recent-onset inflammatory polyarthritis. At baseline, subjects are assessed and examined by a research nurse. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) is administered and the DAS28 (28-joint Disease Activity Score) is calculated. Information is collected on disease-modifying antirheumatic drug exposure. In this study, patients (symptom duration of &lt; 2 years at baseline) were grouped into 4 cohorts (Cohort 1: 1990-1994; Cohort 2: 1995-1999; Cohort 3: 2000-2004; Cohort 4: 2005-2008). The American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) 2010 criteria for RA were applied retrospectively at baseline. Regression analyses were used to examine whether calendar year of presentation to NOAR was associated with baseline HAQ and DAS28 scores. Potential confounders included age at symptom onset, sex, rheumatoid factor, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positivity. A total of 1724 patients met the ACR/EULAR 2010 RA criteria at baseline. Unadjusted mean DAS28 scores decreased over time. Calendar year of presentation to NOAR was significantly associated with lower DAS28 scores over time [Y = 4.51 + (-0.56 × year) + (0.44 × year(2))]. Although unadjusted median HAQ scores increased over time, calendar year of presentation to NOAR was not significantly associated with HAQ scores [Y = (1.1) + (0.023 × year) + (0.05 × year(2))]. Similar results were observed in each subpopulation of patients. While baseline disease activity has lessened slightly over time, there has been no improvement in baseline levels of functional disability.

29439003	Journal Article	Chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) are frequently treated with biological medications, specifically tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi)). These medications inhibit the pro-inflammatory molecule TNF alpha, which has been strongly implicated in the aetiology of these diseases. Up to one-third of patients do not, however, respond to biologics, and lifestyle factors are assumed to affect treatment outcomes. Little is known about the effects of dietary lifestyle as a prognostic factor that may enable personalised medicine. The primary outcome of this multidisciplinary collaborative study will be to identify dietary lifestyle factors that support optimal treatment outcomes. This prospective cohort study will enrol 320 patients with CID who are prescribed a TNFi between June 2017 and March 2019. Included among the patients with CID will be patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn\&#39;s disease and ulcerative colitis), rheumatic disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis), inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa) and non-infectious uveitis. At baseline (pretreatment), patient characteristics will be assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, clinical assessments of disease activity, quality of life and lifestyle, in addition to registry data on comorbidity and concomitant medication(s). In accordance with current Danish standards, follow-up will be conducted 14-16 weeks after treatment initiation. For each disease, evaluation of successful treatment response will be based on established primary and secondary endpoints, including disease-specific core outcome sets. The major outcome of the analyses will be to detect variability in treatment effectiveness between patients with different lifestyle characteristics. The principle goal of this project is to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from CID by providing evidence to support dietary and other lifestyle recommendations that may improve clinical outcomes. The study is approved by the Ethics Committee (S-20160124) and the Danish Data Protecting Agency (2008-58-035). Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, patient associations and presentations at international conferences. NCT03173144; Pre-results.

27965059	Journal Article	Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease of the skin that is sometimes accompanied by an auto-inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Psoriasis and PsA are multifactorial diseases that result from complex interactions of environmental and genetic risk factors. Epigenetic marks, which are labile chemical marks with diverse functions, form a layer of biological information that sits at the interface of genetics and the environment. Aberrant epigenetic regulation has been previously implicated in other rheumatological disorders. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the nascent literature on epigenetics in psoriasis and PsA. A systematic review yielded 52 primary articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized template and study quality assessed using a methodological quality checklist. Studies reflect a broad range of epigenetic sub-disciplines, the most common being DNA methylation, followed by the parent of origin effect or genomic imprinting, expression or activity of epigenetic modifying enzymes, and histone modifications. Epidemiological studies demonstrating excessive paternal transmission provided the earliest evidence of epigenetic deregulation in psoriatic disease, however few studies have examined its molecular mechanisms. Methylation studies evolved rapidly from low resolution global to targeted analyses of known psoriatic disease susceptibility loci such as HLA-C*0602. The recent explosion of epigenome-wide association studies has provided us with novel insights into psoriasis pathogenesis, and the mechanism of action of UVB, methotrexate, and anti-TNF therapies, as well as molecular signatures of psoriasis that may have clinical relevance. Finally, recent studies of pharmacological inhibitors of epigenetic modifier enzymes demonstrate their potential applicability as novel treatment modalities for psoriasis. Challenges of epigenetics research in psoriasis and PsA were identified and future perspectives are discussed herein.

20827447	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disease which affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Recent research on the role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in RA development indicates that they may have pro- or anti-inflammatory effect, most probably via modulating cytokine secretion. We investigated type Th1 (INFγ, TNFα, IL-2) and type Th2 (IL-10, IL-6, IL-4) cytokine levels in sera of RA patients and healthy controls, using flow cytometric bead array assay, and searched for correlations between the cytokine levels and serum antibodies against bacterial (DnaJ) and human (Hdj1, Hdj2 and Hdj3) Hsp40 proteins, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters. The levels of all cytokines studied were significantly increased in RA patients; the highest increase relative to healthy controls (7-fold) was observed for IL-6 and its levels correlated positively with the antibodies directed to DnaJ and to the C-terminal domain of Hdj2, and with diagnostic parameters (DAS 28, Steinbrocker RTG criteria, ARA/7, ESR, TEN, SW and GH). INFγ levels correlated negatively with DAS 28, ESR, TEN and SW. No correlations were found for TNFα, IL-2 or IL-4. Our results support the hypothesis of Hsp40 involvement in RA as well as indicate that IL-6 serum level is a good marker of the RA activity.

21529303	Journal Article	Many human biological processes are regulated by circadian rhythms, which follow 24-h cycles and involve the neuroendocrine and immune systems. Pathological manifestations of this system may also follow circadian rhythms. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), clinical symptoms of joint stiffness, pain, and functional disability are commonly most severe in the early morning. These symptoms closely follow the circadian rhythm of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6. In RA, the increase in nocturnal anti-inflammatory cortisol secretion is insufficient to suppress ongoing inflammation, resulting in the morning symptoms characteristic of RA. Established diagnostic criteria for RA include morning stiffness, although it is not part of the more recent classification criteria developed to guide early treatment decisions. Measures that are widely used to monitor disease control also omit morning stiffness. However, such measures may not capture all disease activity, and one in six patients in remission or with low disease activity still experiences prolonged morning stiffness. Such findings suggest that morning symptoms in RA remain an important marker of active disease that should continue to be monitored.	NA	Scandinavian journal of rheumatology.

8849376	Clinical Trial	To determine the safety and efficacy of recombinant soluble human interleukin-1 receptor type I (rHuIL-1RI) administered subcutaneously in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty-three patients with active RA (&gt;5 swollen joints) were enrolled into a randomized, double-blind, 2-center study. Patients received subcutaneous doses of rHuIL-1RI or placebo for 28 consecutive days. Patients were treated with 125, 250, 500, or 1,000 micrograms/m2/day of rHuIL-1RI. Physical examinations and laboratory assessments were performed at baseline (day 1), and 8, 15, 22, 29, 43, and 57 days after the start of the study. Analysis of peripheral blood by flow cytometry was performed on days 1 and 29 to determine the effects of rHuIL-1RI on the distribution and phenotypic characteristics of circulating inflammatory cells. Four of 8 patients who received rHuIL-1RI at 1,000 micrograms/m2/day demonstrated improvement in at least 1 of 8 individual measures of disease activity; however, only 1 of these 4 patients experienced clinically relevant improvement as defined by predetermined criteria. None of the patients treated with smaller doses of rHuIL-1RI, and none of the placebo-treated control patients, experienced any improvement as defined by the predetermined criteria. Monocyte cell surface IL-1alpha was significantly reduced following treatment with rHuIL-1RI at each dosage. Administration of rHuIL-1RI was stopped prematurely because of dose-limiting rashes in 2 patients treated with 1,000 micrograms/m2/day. No other adverse events prevented completion of the study. Only 1 patient, who was treated with the highest concentration of rHuIL-1RI employed (1,000 micrograms/m2/day), demonstrated clinically relevant improvement in this phase I study on this small group of patients with active RA. Dose-limiting toxicity was also observed in 2 patients treated with this highest concentration of rHuIL-1RI. Treatment with rHuIL-1RI did result in a reduction of monocyte cell surface IL-1alpha, which indicates that the dosages of rHuIL-1RI employed were functional.

8656140	Journal Article	The clinical features of 80 patients with primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (PSS) were revised in order to evaluate the descriptive and analytical facilities of a newly proposed model for classification of the exocrine and nonexocrine disease manifestations in PSS. Retrospective, long-term (median 7.5 years follow-up) observational, clinical study. Patients were recruited from our Department, which is a tertiary referral centre for PSS patients. Eighty patients fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and/or xerostomia and followed between 1972 and 1991 were studied. All patients had \&#39;surface exocrine disease\&#39; and in 31% this was the only disease manifestation. \&#39;Internal organ exocrine disease\&#39; was found in 25% of the patients, whilst 2.5% developed \&#39;monoclonal B lymphocyte disease\&#39; (non-Hodgkin\&#39;s lymphoma). 28% displayed \&#39;inflammatory vascular disease\&#39;, 25% \&#39;noninflammatory vascular disease\&#39;, 41% \&quot;mediator-induced disease\&#39; and 2.5% \&#39;autoimmune endocrine disease\&#39; (thyroiditis). In patients with \&#39;internal organ exocrine disease\&#39; the frequencies of \&quot;mediator-induced disease\&#39; (70%; P &lt; 0.01) and \&#39;inflammatory vascular disease, (50%; P &lt; 0.03) were significantly higher than expected by chance. The level of immunoinflammatory activity (assessed by plasma IgG, serum ANA and focus scoring of minor labial salivary gland biopsies) correlated with the extent of clinical disease as assessed by the model. We conclude that this theoretically based model for classification of disease manifestations in PSS contains descriptive and analytic powers which may assist the clinical handling of these patients.

22422492	Clinical Trial	To prospectively evaluate the disease course and the performance of clinical, patient-reported outcome (PRO) and musculoskeletal ultrasound measures in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The study population included 85 patients with new-onset PMR who were initially treated with prednisone equivalent dose of 15 mg daily tapered gradually, and followed for 26 weeks. Data collection included physical examination findings, laboratory measures of acute-phase reactants, and PRO measures. Ultrasound evaluation was performed at baseline and Week 26 to assess for features previously reported to be associated with PMR. Response to corticosteroid treatment was defined as 70% improvement in PMR on visual analog scale (VAS). At baseline, 77% had hip pain in addition to shoulder pain and 100% had abnormal C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. On ultrasound, 84% had shoulder findings and 32% had both shoulder and hip findings. Response to corticosteroid treatment occurred in 73% of patients by Week 4 and was highly correlated with percentage improvement in other VAS measures. Presence of ultrasound findings at baseline predicted response to corticosteroids at 4 weeks. Factor analysis revealed 6 domains that sufficiently represented all the outcome measures: PMR-related pain and physical function, an elevated inflammatory marker, hip pain, global pain, mental function, and morning stiffness. PRO measures and inflammatory markers performed well in assessing disease activity in patients with PMR. A minimum set of outcome measures consisting of PRO measures of pain and function and an inflammatory marker should be used in practice and in clinical trials in PMR.

22461187	Journal Article	We determined the prevalence of work disability in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) and undifferentiated early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) patients at first enrollment into the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort (CATCH) who met the 2010 ACR criteria versus those not meeting criteria, to determine the impact of meeting new criteria on work disability status. Data at first visit into the cohort were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association of other variables in our database with work disability. 1,487 patients were enrolled in the CATCH study, a multi-site observational, prospective cohort of patients with EIA. 934 patients were excluded (505 based on missing criteria for ACR 2010 classification, as anti-CCP was absent, and 429 were not working for other reasons). Of the 553 patients included, 71 % were female with mean disease duration of 6.4 months. 524 (94.8 %) were employed while 29 (5.2 %) reported work disability at first visit. There were no differences between those meeting 2010 ACR criteria versus those who did not. Baseline characteristics associated with work disability were male gender, age, education, income, HAQ, and positive RF status. The mean HAQ score in work disabled patients was 1.4 versus 0.9 in those who were working (p &lt; 0.001). Disease activity score (DAS28) was not associated with work disability (p = 0.069), nor was tender joint count, swollen joint count, anti-CCP, patient global assessment, or SF-12v2. In the regression model, work disability was associated with lower income levels (p = 0.01) and worse HAQ scores (OR 2.33; p = 0.001), but not significantly associated with male gender (p = 0.08), older age (&gt;50 years; p = 0.3), lower education (p = 0.3) or RF positivity (p = 0.6). We found rates of work disability to be low at entry into this EIA cohort compared to previous studies. There may be potential for intervention in ERA to prevent the development of work disability.

2952088	English Abstract	We studied atrial appendages and valvular apparatus from patients undergoing cardiac surgery for rheumatic heart disease, looking for active histologic lesions. After reviewing 673 specimens (1980-1985) we studied two groups: 31 cases with Aschoff nodules or ill-differentiated histopathological lesions, and 31 cases, without tissular inflammatory abnormalities. In the former we found 8 cases with suspected clinical activity in a 3 months period before surgery, in the latter only 2 cases had similar findings. The Jones criteria are not useful for recognizing rheumatic activity among patients with chronic rheumatic heart disease, there is no clinical-histopathological correlations and it is possible that chronic inflammation occurs at the heart as an organ-limited condition.

15308515	Clinical Trial	To compare the short term clinical and biological effects of intravenous (i.v.) pulse methylprednisolone (MP) and infliximab (IFX) in patients with severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment. Patients with active RA despite MTX treatment were randomly allocated to receive a single i.v. infusion of MP (1 g) or three i.v. infusions of IFX (3 mg/kg) on weeks 0, 2, and 6. Patients were \&quot;blindly\&quot; evaluated for disease activity measures. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated through the SF-36 health survey. Serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) titres were measured at baseline, weeks 2 and 6. Compared with baseline, significant improvement was noted in all activity measures, including serum C reactive protein (CRP) titres, in the IFX group only. At week 14, 6/9 (67%) and 4/9 (44%) IFX patients met the ACR20 and 50 response criteria, while this was the case in only 1/12 (8%) and 0/12 (0%) MP patients, respectively (p&lt;0.05). None of the QoL scales improved with MP treatment, whereas some did so in the IFX group. Serum MMP-3 titres significantly decreased (41% drop) at week 6 in the IFX group, while no changes were seen in patients given MP. This short term randomised comparative study demonstrates that TNF blockade is better than MP pulse therapy in a subset of patients with severe refractory RA, with improvement in not only clinical parameters of disease activity but also biological inflammatory indices, such as serum CRP and MMP-3 titres.

27075461	Journal Article	An increased incidence of cardiovascular disease has been found in rheumatic disorders. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children. Prolonged immunological inflammatory process leads these patients to an early onset of atherosclerosis. We aimed to assess the presence of early vascular dysfunction in patients with systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) and investigate the role of therapy sJIA in vascular health. Thirty-three patients (22 males, 11 females) diagnosed with sJIA according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria were compared to 72 age- and sex-matched controls. None of the participants was overweight, obese, or had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or cardiovascular disease. Arterial stiffness (As) was evaluated by measurement of carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx) with a Vicorder. The mean age of patients in this study was 9.96 ± 3.71 years (range 4-16 years) and the mean age of controls was 10.9 ± 3.52 years (range 4-19 years). These two groups were well matched for age, sex, and BMI. The mean age of patients at the onset of disease was 7.06 ± 3.9 years (range 3-15 years). The mean duration of disease and active disease was 79 ± 45 months (range 6-162 months) and 58 ± 49 months (range 1-101 months), respectively. The highest levels of PWV and AIx were found in the patient group. Seven patients had had macrophage activation syndrome at presentation. In these patients, vascular changes were higher than other patients (6.30 ± 0.42 m/s vs 5.17 ± 0.55 m/s, p = 0.01, respectively). The corticosteroid therapy was found associated with higher PWV, (p &lt; 0.05), while there was no difference between vascular parameters and use of non-steroid therapies (methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNF alfa agents). We also find statistically significant correlation between PWV and disease duration (p = 0.003, r = 0.45). Vascular function is impaired in patients with sJIA at a very young age. Vascular dysfunction may be partly attributed to the effects of disease-related characteristics (inflammation, disease activity, and medications).

12384930	Journal Article	To evaluate features during the first 6 months of disease that may be associated with a poor outcome as measured principally by extension to a polyarticular disease course in patients with oligoarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (oligo-JRA). This study was a retrospective review of patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for oligo-JRA, were followed up for at least 5 years, and did not have juvenile psoriatic arthritis, spondylarthropathy-like disease, or rheumatoid factor positivity. Data from the first 6 months of disease were collected. Continuous variables were dichotomized and then screened by univariate analysis for association with poor outcome at the last followup visit, as measured by extension of involvement (&gt;4 accumulated involved joints) and by \&quot;clinically meaningful\&quot; extension (&gt; or =10 accumulated joints). Variables significantly associated with this latter outcome, with the addition of disease duration as a confounding independent variable, were included in a multiple logistic regression analysis. The same variables were then examined in separate multiple logistic regression models to look at other measures of outcome, including use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at any time, erosive disease on radiographs, any remission of disease ever occurring, physician\&#39;s global assessment of disease activity at the last visit, and disability as measured by the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (C-HAQ)/HAQ. Of the 205 patients (160 of whom were female) studied for a median of 10.8 years (range 5-26.6 years), 39.5% developed extension to &gt;4 joints and 17.6% developed arthritis in &gt; or =10 joints. Using the logistic regression model, symmetric disease was predictive of all measures of poor outcome: extension to &gt; or =10 joints (odds ratio [OR] 19.2), the need to use DMARDs (OR 11.5), radiographic demonstration of erosive disease (OR 4.73), inflammatory activity at last followup visit (OR 3.23), no remission of disease (OR 4.73), and disability as measured by a C-HAQ score &gt;0.12 (OR 2.95). Ankle and/or wrist disease was predictive of extension (OR 6.61) and erosions (OR 3.59). Wrist disease alone was predictive of the need to use DMARDs (OR 5.87) and of inflammatory disease activity at the last followup visit (OR 4.01). An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was predictive of extension (OR 3.76), the need to use DMARDs (OR 6.47), and no remission of disease (OR 2.30). Disease duration was a confounding variable for extension (OR 1.18) and erosive disease (OR 1.19). The early presence of ankle and/or wrist disease, symmetric joint involvement, and an elevated ESR in a child with oligo-JRA indicates the likelihood of disease progression.

26088683	Journal Article	In primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (pSS), muscle pain and/or muscular weakness is relatively frequent while myositis has been reported in 3% of patients. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of myositis in a multicentre Italian pSS cohort and to address the clinical manifestations, histological findings and therapeutic strategies. Clinical, serological and therapeutic data from a pSS cohort of patients were retrospectively collected. According to Bohan and Peter\&#39;s criteria, inflammatory myopathy (IM) was suspected in case of muscular weakness associated with increased creatine-phosphokinase (CPK) or abnormal electromyography (EMG). When performed, muscle biopsies were analysed. In a cohort of 1320 patients, 17 (1.28%) presented muscular weakness [in some cases myalgias (7/17, 41.1%)], accompanied by increased CPK [13/17, (76.4%)] and/or abnormal EMG [13/14, (92.8%)]. Ten out of 17 (58.8%) fulfilled at least three diagnostic criteria for IM. Muscular biopsy was performed in 13/17 (76.4%) cases with histologically confirmed myositis in 6/13 (46.1%) (1\&quot;IBM-like\&quot;-5\&quot;PM-like\&quot;). In two \&quot;PM-like\&quot; cases, several fibres showed a decreased histochemical cytochrome C oxidase (COX) stain. Two biopsies tested \&quot;negative\&quot;, four showed \&quot;non-specific\&quot; findings. All patients were treated with corticosteroids followed by different DMARDs. Our retrospective analysis shows a prevalence of myositis in pSS lower than previously reported, mainly appearing as an overlapping syndrome. Histological findings confirm the possible presence of an IBM or of a myopathy more similar to PM with a decreased COX activity. Classical immunosuppressants are effective although in most difficult cases IVIg or RTX may be used with benefit.

19606939	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder primarily targeting the synovium. Unchecked disease activity is associated with significant morbidity and an increased mortality. Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of RA and the capability of biologically engineered treatments for RA have expanded the armamentarium of antirheumatic agents. A systematic literature review was conducted through PubMed. At present, a common strategy for the treatment of RA uses methotrexate either as monotherapy or in combination with a variety of conventional and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with the goal of inducing remission of active disease. The choice of which agent(s) to use is based upon patient-specific criteria (activity of disease, comorbidities, patient preferences, costs etc.). Emerging therapies that target specific cytokines and growth factors in the inflammatory cascade of RA offer a potent new means of modifying disease activity, but many questions regarding their use remain unanswered.

16708557	Clinical Trial	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which cytokines play an important role. The therapy of RA is associated with application of the drugs modulating the immune response via inhibiting the cytokine production. The common drugs used in RA therapy are methotrexate and prednisone. Recent investigations showed the importance of genetically determined differences in cytokine production in RA activity and therapy. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of - 174 interleukin-6 (IL-6) promoter polymorphism on the efficacy of treatment of RA patients with methotrexate and prednisone. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for analysis of the polymorphism at IL-6 gene. Seventy patients with RA diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology were investigated. The patients were divided into two subgroups. The first subgroup included patients who have obtained remission for at least 6 months after therapy with methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids. The second subgroup included patients with active disease despite at least 6 months of therapy with methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids. It has been shown that the incidence of remission after therapy with methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids was significantly lower in patients with GG genotype as compared with GC and CC genotypes p&lt; 0.05. We suggest that -174 IL-6 promoter polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor determining the effectiveness of RA treatement with methotrexate and glucocorticosteroids.

15785261	Clinical Trial	Intraarticular hyaluronic acid is indicated for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. However, clinical experience, especially efficacy and adverse events, with repeated injection series in the long term are limited. Patients were referred to a large primary care center for management of osteoarthritis of the knee. All were naive to intraarticular hyaluronic acid therapy and met our entry criteria, including resting visual analog scale pain of &gt; 45 mm, radiographic confirmation of unilateral knee grade 1-3 osteoarthritis, and willingness to receive intraarticular therapy. Patients received a three-intraarticular injection series with Suplasyn (10 mg/ml, 2-ml injection) over 3 wks. Patients were instructed to return for consideration of repeat injection series based on their perception of pain restricting daily activity and a resumption of severity similar to their initial presentation. This prospective naturalistic cohort was followed for 6.7 yrs. Patients completed baseline assessment of rest and walking visual analog scale pain (primary efficacy variable), completed a 5-point categorical global satisfaction score, and recorded adverse events and concomitant therapeutic modality use at each study visit. Patients returned for consideration of a repeat injection series based on their perception of symptom severity and were eligible if their resting visual analog scale pain was &gt; 45 mm. The three-injection series and data collection were repeated, and again, patients were given similar instructions regarding consideration of a third injection series. Of 897 referral patients, 537 (mean age, 68 +/- 8 yrs; mean duration of symptoms, 7.4 +/- 4.1 yrs) met our criteria, and only 21 patients did not return for a second injection series. The mean time between first and second series was 27 +/- 7 wks. The change in walking visual analog scale pain was significantly improved from baseline after the first series (81.3%, P &lt; 0.001) and second series (86.7%, P &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, resting visual analog scale pain was significantly decreased from baseline after the first (P &lt; 0.001) and second (P &lt; 0.001) series, and patient satisfaction was significantly improved with each injection series (P &lt; 0.03 and P &lt; 0.01). Very few adverse events were recorded and were limited to local pain and swelling. Use of concomitant therapeutic modalities at presentation for a second injection series included: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/cyclooxygenase-2 medications (37%), acetaminophen (31%), oral nutraceuticals (12%), and physical therapy and bracing (12%). Intraarticular hyaluronic acid injections were highly effective in improving resting and walking pain in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee on a first and a second treatment series. Duration of symptom control was about 6 mos, and the therapy was highly satisfactory to patients and was associated with very few local adverse events and limited use of concomitant therapeutic modalities. These data support the potential role of intraarticular hyaluronic acid as an effective long-term therapeutic option for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

Thirty patients diagnosed with RA through American College of Rheumatology criteria as well as 30 healthy patients were selected. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated, and E-NTPDase and E-ADA activities were assayed. The results demonstrated an increased E-NTPDase activity (both ATP and ADP as substrates) and a decreased E-ADA activity in RA patients. These data suggest an organic effort to preserve the adenosine level, which is known to have anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties, working as a potent suppressor of immune response.

21885500	Journal Article	Serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) has been shown to reflect disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis. Elevated levels have been found in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). In the enthesitis-related arthritis category of JIA (JIA-ERA), we studied whether serum MMP-3 levels and ratios of MMP-3/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP-1) are correlated with disease activity and whether they are sensitive to change in disease activity. A total of 54 patients with JIA-ERA (International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria) were enrolled for study. Baseline disease activity measures included tender and swollen joint counts, Maastricht AS Enthesitis Score, Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), patient assessment of pain and global disease activity, physician assessment of global disease activity, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Serum MMP-3 and TIMP-1 levels were measured using ELISA. A group of 24 patients were followed up for longitudinal study. The mean age of 54 patients (48 males) at disease onset was 11.8 ± 4.19 years and duration of disease was 5.2 ± 4.3 years. Median ESR was 65 mm/h (range 46.5-97) and median BASDAI was 3.4 (range 2.5-4.7). Median MMP-3, TIMP-1, and MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratio were 50.4 ng/ml (IQR 13.0-193.8), 228.9 ng/ml (IQR 108.2-290.4), and 0.3 (IQR 0.07-1.13), respectively. At inclusion MMP-3 levels correlated directly with various disease activity measures: tender joint count (TJC; r = 0.60), swollen joint count (SJC; r = 0.45), BASFI (r = 0.29), BASDAI (r = 0.32), ESR (r = 0.49), physician global assessment (r = 0.40), patient visual analog scale for pain (r = 0.28), and patient global assessment (r = 0.38; all p &lt; 0.05). MMP-3/TIMP-1 ratio correlated only with TJC (r = 0.51), SJC (r = 0.39), and ESR (r = 0.34; p &lt; 0.05). At followup, change in MMP-3 correlated with changes in TJC (r = 0.42) and SJC (r = 0.44; p &lt; 0.05), while change in ESR did not correlate with change in any disease activity measure. MMP-3 levels are a good marker for disease activity in JIA-ERA.

29679167	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory disease that causes destruction of joints. Accurate recognition of active disease has significant implications in determining appropriate treatment; however, there is significant inter-rater variability in clinical joint assessment. This study aimed to assess the utility of thermographic imaging in the evaluation of inflammatory arthritis activity as an adjunct to clinical assessment. This was a cross-sectional study of 79 subjects recruited from the University of Alberta Outpatient Rheumatology clinic comparing the hand joints of 49 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria to 30 healthy volunteers. Convenience sampling of consecutive RA patients was undertaken. The effect of clinical assessment (HAQ and DAS-28) on joint temperature was evaluated using a linear mixed effect model. A thermography camera, FLIR T300 model, 30 Hz, was used to obtain both thermographic and digital images on subjects. Pearson\&#39;s correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation of clinical assessments and average joint temperature averaged over all joints. Thermographic analysis did not associate with clinical measures of disease activity. In RA patients, there was no statistically significant relationship between joint temperature and clinical assessment of disease activity including Health Assessment Questionnaire (coefficient estimate - 0.54, p = 0.056), swollen joints (coefficient estimate - 0.09, p = 0.238), or serologic markers of inflammation such as CRP (coefficient estimate - 0.006, p = 0.602) and ESR (coefficient estimate - 0.01, p = 0.503). Evaluation of disease activity requires a multifaceted approach that includes clinical assessment and appropriate imaging. There may be a role for thermography in assessment of larger joints; however, it does not appear to be an effective modality for the small joints of the hand.

29973088	Journal Article	The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of widespread pain (WP) in women with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to compare physical function, activity limitations, health-related quality of life, mental distress, and disease activity between women with WP and non-widespread pain (NWP). This cross-sectional study included 102 women with early RA. Participants were provided with self-reported questionnaires quantifying activity limitations, physical activity, pain intensity, health-related quality of life, and fatigue. Hand-grip force, muscle function test of the lower extremities, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and number of tender and swollen joints were assessed. One-third (35.9%) of the women fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for WP 20 months after disease onset. Women with RA + WP had significantly higher 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) (p = 0.004), number of tender joints (p = 0.001), pain intensity (p &lt; 0.001), fatigue (p &lt; 0.001), Health Assessment Questionnaire score (p &lt; 0.001), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Depression (p = 0.001). Furthermore, women with RA + WP showed significantly worse global health (p &lt; 0.001) and physical health (36-item Short Form Health Survey - Physical Component Summary) (p &lt; 0.001). The hand-grip force was found to be significantly reduced (p = 0.001), as was the muscle function of the lower extremities (p &lt; 0.001), for women with RA + WP compared to women with RA + NWP. After adjustment for inflammatory joint disease, the significant differences between the groups remained. A significant group of women with early RA experience WP with a high DAS28 and increased pain intensity level. These women display severe muscle function deficiency in clinical examinations, and report general activity limitations and low psychological and physical health, despite an absence of or low objective signs of inflammation.

26709220	Journal Article	IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-12 cytokine family. IL-23 is essential for the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes, a subtype of T lymphocyte implicated in chronic inflammatory/autoimmune mediated diseases. Experimental models of arthritis and clinical indications have highlighted an important role for Th17 lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of RA. However the role and mechanism of action of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of RA are still not fully understood. This study was conducted to assess the level of IL-23 in patients with RA as well as the relationship between the IL-23 level and disease activity. The study includes 77 patients with RA fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) revised criteria for diagnosis of RA as well as 25 age and sex matched healthy subjects as controls. Patients were divided according to disease activity into four groups: DAS 28 score (˂ 2.6), 10 patients in remission, DAS 28 score between 2.6-3.2, 10 patients with low disease activity, DAS 28 score ranges between (3.2-5.1), 30 patients with moderate disease activity and DAS 28 score (˂ 5.1), 27 patients with High disease activity. Disease activity were determined by the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS 28). Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) was done. The levels of IL-23 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum level of IL-23 was significantly elevated in RA patients (78.92±52.47) compared to control group (33.34±3.99) (P&lt;0.001). However, no correlations were found between IL-23 and DAS 28 score, and other patients characteristics. Our results imply that IL-23 may potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of RA and may be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of this disease. Targeting the IL-23 cytokine may provide a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of RA.

17083755	Journal Article	The rheumatology community has devoted increasing attention to the subject of remission over the past 2 decades, on the basis of greater appreciation of the long-term severity of inflammatory rheumatic diseases and availability of new therapies and approaches to improve outcomes. Nonetheless, description of remission in rheumatic diseases is complex, compared to many nonrheumatic diseases. Recognition of remission requires a set of measures or an index rather than a single \&quot;gold standard.\&quot; Spontaneous remission is not infrequent in people with early inflammatory arthritis, including some who may meet criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over less than a few months, and may be confused with a drug-induced remission. Remission may be transient in many patients over short periods, and the length of time required to maintain remission status varies in different reports. Maintenance of a state of remission in autoimmune diseases that result from dysregulatory processes, rather than invasion of foreign cells or toxins, generally requires ongoing therapy indefinitely. Patients who have organ damage or functional disability may be described as \&quot;in remission,\&quot; although they are free of disease activity only, but not necessarily free of disease consequences. A status of \&quot;low disease activity\&quot; or \&quot;near remission\&quot; with 70% to 90% of the features of an ideal remission may be adequate for many people with rheumatic diseases to avoid risks that may be required to reach 100% remission status. Thus, the subject of remission remains under active discussion in the rheumatology community.

23981750	Journal Article	Remission is an ideal target in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1981 preliminary definition of remission, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease activity score of 28 joints - C-reactive protein (DAS28 (3)-CRP) and DAS28 (3)-ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and newer ACR/EULAR remission criteria from 2011. We assessed the agreement between these definitions using kappa statistics in a real-time clinical scenario. This is a cross sectional study in which 460 patients\&#39; charts were reviewed. Their data on tender and swollen joint counts, visual analogue scale of patient global assessment (Pt GA), ESR and CRP were retrieved. One hundred patients who fulfilled one of the remission criteria and had all the required five variables were selected and they were categorized into remission using all the four definitions. Only one case out of 100 fulfilled all four remission criteria. Among 100 cases: ACR 1981 classified six in remission; ACR/EULAR 2011, eight; DAS28 (3)-ESR, 24; and DAS28 (3)-CRP classified 100 patients in remission. A substantial number of patients continued to have features suggesting persisting active inflammation, despite being categorized into remission. A major portion of disagreement was in ESR and CRP. The value spread of all clinical parameters such as swollen joint count, tender joint count and Pt GA had no significant difference in the patients classified as being in remission. The DAS28 (3)-CRP overestimated remission compared to all other criteria. Disagreement was more in laboratory inflammatory parameters. A uniform definition of remission is needed.

20132965	Journal Article	To review the current evidence regarding the value of measuring procalcitonin (PCT) levels in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, with a focus on the evidence for diagnostic and analytical performance of this biomarker. A brief description of the pathophysiological basis of this biomarker is also included. Using PubMed from the National Library of Medicine, relevant English literature on PCT in patients with different systemic autoimmune diseases, from 1990 to 2009, was reviewed. The search used keywords referring to procalcitonin and systemic lupus erythematosus, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated systemic vasculitis, Goodpasture syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and giant cell arteritis. When used in the appropriate clinical setting, the measurement of serum PCT levels is valuable as a marker of severe systemic bacterial and fungal infections and sepsis. Information regarding plasma PCT levels in patients with active underlying systemic autoimmune diseases is limited, primarily from observational studies and case series, with considerable variability of patient characteristics and clinical settings. In the detection of systemic infection concomitant with autoimmune diseases, PCT had a diagnostic sensitivity of 53 to 100% and a specificity of 84 to 97% (depending on the selection criteria) and was superior to other inflammatory markers tested. Most of the studies used a semiquantitative test for PCT measurement (functional assay sensitivity &lt;0.5 ng/mL), which can explain the low sensitivity of the test. PCT levels were not significantly affected by renal function abnormalities or immunosuppressive agents. Although high PCT levels commonly occurred with infection, elevated levels of PCT could be found in patients with vasculitis without evidence of infection, often correlated with high disease activity scores. Significantly elevated PCT levels offer good specificity and sensitivity for systemic infection in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases, regardless of the use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents. PCT measurement may add to diagnostic accuracy in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases who present with a febrile illness, especially when highly sensitive PCT assays and specific PCT cutoff ranges are used in a predefined clinical setting (reflecting the likelihood of infection versus an autoimmune disease flare). However, there are limitations when using this biomarker in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases. PCT levels should not replace the necessary extensive diagnostic workup, which should include a thorough history and physical examination, combined with appropriate immunological, microbiological, radiological, and histological data.

20391510	Journal Article	Low-dose aspirin may reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through its effect on cyclooxygenase activity and its antioxidant pathways. Previous randomized trial data have demonstrated a beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin in reducing other inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and colorectal adenomas, but no trial has evaluated the role of aspirin in RA prevention. The Women\&#39;s Health Study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between 1992 and 2004 designed to evaluate the risks and benefits of low-dose aspirin (100 mg every other day) and vitamin E in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer among 39,876 female health care professionals age &gt; or =45 years throughout the US. After excluding women with RA at baseline, 39,144 women were evaluated for the present study. A definite diagnosis of RA was assessed during followup by self-report and confirmed using a connective tissue disease screening questionnaire, followed by a medical record review by a rheumatologist for American College of Rheumatology criteria. During an average followup of 10 years, 106 women developed definite RA (48 women in the aspirin group and 58 in the placebo group). There was a nonsignificant risk for RA (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.56-1.21; P = 0.33) associated with aspirin. There were 64 seropositive RA cases (60%) and 42 seronegative RA cases (40%). Aspirin also had no significant effect on either seropositive RA (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.61-1.63) or seronegative RA (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.33-1.15). One hundred milligrams of aspirin taken every other day was not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing RA among women in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

11759233	Case Reports	Clinical quality management in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aims at reducing inflammatory activity and pain in the short term and damage and disability in the long term. In the \&quot;Swiss Clinical Quality Management in rheumatoid arthritis\&quot; (SCQM) project, which started in 1997, a measurement-improvement system with feedback reports allows the rheumatologists to follow their RA patients with the aim of improving the quality of outcome. Inflammatory activity is measured with the Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index questionnaire (RADAI), damage with an X-ray score and disability with the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). The feedback is used by the individual rheumatologist to optimize the therapy of his/her RA patients. Beside the aim of improving the quality of treatment, the SCQM projects wants to build a Swiss cohort of RA patients, to improve the collaboration of rheumatologists in the clinic and in practice and to establish standards of treatment in RA. In this paper we describe the SCQM project in detail, we show two cases illustrating the usefulness of the SCQM in the management of individual RA patients, and we present the cross sectional analysis of the first 1223 RA patients included in the project.

29353099	Journal Article	Systemic autoimmune diseases can affect various kinds of organs including the kidney, the skin, soft tissue and the bone. Among others, cardiovascular involvement in rheumatic diseases has been shown to affect myocardium, pericardium, cardiac vessels, conduction system and valves, eventually leading to increased mortality. In general, underlying chronic inflammation leads to premature atherosclerosis, but also other manifestations such as arrhythmia and heart failure may have a \&#39;silent\&#39; progress. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors play a secondary role, while disease-specific factors (i.e. disease duration, severity, antibody positivity, persistent disease activity) can directly influence the cardiovascular system. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical to optimize management and to control inflammatory activity and recent data suggest that risk factors (i.e. hypercholesterolemia and hypertension) need intensive treatment as well. With the advent of immunosuppressive agents, most rheumatic diseases are well controlled on treatment, but information related to their cardioprotective efficacy is not well-defined. In this review, we focus on cardiovascular involvement in rheumatic diseases and highlight current evidence which should be of help for the treating physicians. Moreover, cardiotoxicity of immunosuppressive drugs is a rare issue and such potential adverse events will be briefly discussed.

18278834	Comparative Study	Patients with symptoms and signs compatible with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with or without psoriasis, have been documented in the Swedish Early Psoriatic Arthritis (SwePsA) register. Our aim was to find markers for disease progression and to evaluate treatments for PsA using these data. Patients referred to rheumatology outpatient clinics within 2 years of onset were assessed on inclusion and at followup 2 years later. Data collection was performed according to the program for SwePsA, and classification was as described by Moll and Wright and the ClASsification Criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR). Remission was recorded if the patient had no tender or swollen joints and if erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were within the reference range. Patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recruited from the Swedish Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Register (Ramona) provided comparison data. One hundred thirty-five patients with PsA according to CASPAR were assessed; 44% were classified as having mono/oligoarthritis and 47% as polyarthritis. Two patients (1%) were in remission initially, and 23 (17%) at followup. Patients with polyarticular disease had the highest inflammatory activity, measured by swollen and tender joint counts, ESR, Health Assessment Questionnaire, and self-assessment by visual analog scale of pain and global disease activity. Dactylitis was associated with radiological findings. Compared with RA patients, they had significantly lower CRP, ESR, and number of swollen joints (p = 0.0003, p = 0.0026, p = 0.0380, respectively) at inclusion, but equal numbers of tender joints and self-assessment of pain and disease activity. About half the patients had polyarthritis and the other half had mono/oligoarthritis at followup after 2 years. Patients with polyarthritis had the highest inflammatory activity. Apart from ESR, CRP, and swollen joint count, there were no significant differences in activity between RA and polyarticular PsA.

19644849	Clinical Trial, Phase III	To assess the safety and efficacy of golimumab in methotrexate (MTX)-naive patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MTX-naive patients with RA (n = 637) were randomized to receive placebo plus MTX (group 1), golimumab 100 mg plus placebo (group 2), golimumab 50 mg plus MTX (group 3), or golimumab 100 mg plus MTX (group 4). Subcutaneous injections of golimumab or placebo were administered every 4 weeks. The dosage of MTX/placebo capsules started at 10 mg/week and escalated to 20 mg/week. The primary end point, the proportion of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 50% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR50 response) at week 24, required significant differences between groups 3 and 4 combined (combined group) versus group 1 and significant differences in a pairwise comparison (group 3 or group 4 versus group 1). An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of the ACR50 response at week 24 did not show a significant difference between the combined group and group 1 (38.4% and 29.4%, respectively; P=0.053), while a post hoc modified ITT analysis (excluding 3 untreated patients) of the ACR50 response showed statistically significant differences between the combined group and group 1 (38.5% versus 29.4%; P=0.049) and between group 3 (40.5%; P=0.038) but not group 4 (36.5%; P=0.177) and group 1. Group 2 was noninferior to group 1 for the ACR50 response at week 24 (33.1%; 95% confidence interval lower bound -5.2%; predefined delta value for noninferiority -10%). The combination of golimumab plus MTX demonstrated a significantly better response compared with placebo plus MTX in most other efficacy parameters, including response/remission according to the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints. Serious adverse events occurred in 7%, 3%, 6%, and 6% of patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Although the primary end point was not met, the modified ITT analysis of the primary end point and other prespecified efficacy measures demonstrated that the efficacy of golimumab plus MTX is better than, and the efficacy of golimumab alone is similar to, the efficacy of MTX alone in reducing RA signs and symptoms in MTX-naive patients, with no unexpected safety concerns.

19246077	Journal Article	We reviewed the literature to evaluate the role of common laboratory tests and to examine the recent progress in the laboratory diagnosis of pediatric rheumatic diseases. We used the PubMed database (1950-2008) to search for the keywords \&quot;laboratory,\&quot; \&quot;erythrocyte sedimentation rate\&quot; (ESR), \&quot;C-reactive protein\&quot; (CRP), \&quot;blood cytology,\&quot; \&quot;procalcitonin\&quot; (PCT), \&quot;complement system,\&quot; \&quot;ferritin,\&quot; \&quot;antistreptolysin O titer\&quot; (ASO), \&quot;autoantibodies,\&quot; \&quot;genetic studies,\&quot; in conjunction with \&quot;rheumatic disease in children\&quot; and \&quot;pediatric autoimmune diseases.\&quot; All relevant original and review articles in English were reviewed as well as textbooks of pediatric rheumatology. Laboratory tests (ESR, CRP, blood cytology, complement system, ferritin, ASO titer) play an important role in confirming a diagnosis and in the follow-up of rheumatic diseases in the pediatric age group. The ESR is probably the most widely measured index of the acute phase response. Measurement of CRP is very useful in the rapid diagnosis of infection as a progressive increase can be shown in the first 48 hours. Also, the subsequent fall in serum CRP concentration on resolution of inflammation is useful for monitoring the efficacy of treatment. In chronic diseases, a combination of CRP and ESR may provide the most useful information. Cytopenia and different forms of anemia can be encountered in many rheumatic diseases: they can be related to disease activity or to therapeutic side effects. Determination of complement levels (C3 and/or C4) is useful in the follow-up of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Ferritin is a laboratory hallmark of primary and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. ASO titer should be obtained to confirm a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever; other important antibody markers of streptococcal infection include antihyaluronidase, antideoxyribonuclease B, and antistreptokinase antibodies. We also found that, in the pediatric age, the main indication for synovial fluid analysis is suspected joint infection. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith antigen, and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies are important in the diagnosis of SLE, are useful prognostic markers, and facilitate clinical and treatment follow-up. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies are associated with Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome and congenital heart block, while the anti-U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein antibodies show high specificity for mixed connective tissue disease. Repetitive spontaneous abortions, thrombocytopenia, and many types of venous or arterial thrombosis are associated with antiphospholipid antibodies. The presence of cytoplasmic antineutrophil antibodies is essential in the diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis. The discovery of underlying single causative gene defects led to the identification of several autoinflammatory diseases, a group of genetic disorders characterized by recurrent attacks of inflammation (hereditary periodic fever syndromes). These include familial Mediterranean fever due to mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene, hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome due to mutations in the MK gene for mevalonate kinase, cryopyrinopathies such as Muckle-Wells syndrome or neonatal-onset multisystemic inflammatory disease (neonatal-onset multisystemic inflammatory disease or chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA)) associated with cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 gene mutations, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome due to mutation of TNF receptor I gene. Laboratory investigations play an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of inflammatory rheumatic diseases in children. A good history and a complete physical examination are the best screening tests. Routine laboratory tests are useful to confirm a suspected diagnosis, to assess disease activity, and to measure the response and toxicity to treatment. Only a few tests represent diagnostic criteria such as antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA in SLE or cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies in Wegener\&#39;s granulomatosis. Recent advances in molecular genetics have impacted diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment in genetic fever syndromes.

21122546	Case Reports	Arthritis and arthralgia are the most common extra-intestinal manifestations of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), occurring in up to a third of patients. These may affect the peripheral or axial skeletal system and may or may not reflect disease activity. As a result, it is challenging to identify an alternative diagnosis to account for joint manifestations in the setting of IBD. We describe a case of a 30 year old woman with quiescent Crohn\&#39;s colitis who presented with 2 weeks of fever, flitting arthralgia, a sore throat and a nocturnal rash on her thighs. She denied any gastrointestinal symptoms to suggest a flare up of IBD. Investigations revealed a neutrophilia and a markedly elevated serum ferritin. The patient met all four major and several minor Yamaguchi criteria for Adult Onset Still\&#39;s Disease (AOSD). She was treated with corticosteroids and analgesia with resolution of her symptoms and normalisation of her biochemical markers. While joint manifestations are the most common extra-intestinal symptoms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, atypical presentations should raise the concern of an additional diagnosis. This case represents a rare presentation of Crohn\&#39;s disease complicated by AOSD.

29946742	Case Reports	The efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody to the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor, in suppressing disease activity in glucocorticoid-naïve patients with new-onset polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) was studied. Its effect on a panel of cytokines and growth factors was evaluated. Three patients, fulfilling the PMR ACR/EULAR criteria, received TCZ at the dosage of 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks for three times followed by prednisone 0.2 mg/kg in case of inefficacy. Concentrations of IL-10, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-γ, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were measured at baseline, after 72 h of the first TCZ infusion and then at weeks 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, and 22. A slight clinical improvement was seen only after the first TCZ infusion, but was largely inferior to that of conventional doses of GC administered subsequently. An ischaemic visual accident suggestive of GCA occurred in one patient during TCZ treatment. IL-6 was increased at baseline compared to controls, further increased after the first TCZ infusion, and was suppressed by GC. IL-17 production decreased during TCZ treatment and reverted to pre-treatment levels after GC. VEGF e PDGF showed a less constant pattern, but an increase of VEGF concentration antedated visual symptoms. The other cytokines were not detectable in patients and controls. In our small sample, TCZ was not able to suppress inflammation at the same degree as GC. As a result, monotherapy with TCZ in PMR cannot be recommended, although its efficacy as adjunctive treatment in GC-resistant patients should be further evaluated.

24760193	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the joints that has a strong correlation with HLA-DRB1. Family history is considered a known risk factor for RA. The aims of this study were to compare the frequency of HLA-DRB1 alleles between patients with sporadic and familial RA and also between healthy controls with RA patients (sporadic and familial) and clarify if familial RA is more severe than sporadic RA. This study included 129 consecutive patients with sporadic and 48 cases with familial (first-degree siblings) RA who visited a rheumatology unit. Demographic data, including extra-articular involvement, mean disease activity according to DAS28 (ESR) criteria, and main laboratory findings, were compared between patients with sporadic and familial RA. HLA-DRB1 typing was carried out using the PCR-SSP method, and the frequency of each allele was determined in all cases and compared with the results of HLA-DRB1 frequencies in 72 healthy controls who were previously reported by our group in northeast Iran. Patients with sporadic and familial RA were matched in age and sex, most of the cases in both groups were females. The mean age of patients was 45 years. Ocular involvement was the most frequent extra-articular manifestation of our patients. There was no significant difference between the two groups in visual analogue scale (VAS) index, number of inflamed or tender joints, extra-articular involvements, and main laboratory findings. HLA-DRB1* 01 (55 %), 04 (48 %), and 03 (43 %) alleles were the most frequent alleles in both sporadic and familial diseases. The frequency of HLA-DRB1*11 and HLA-DRB1*13 was significantly higher in normal participants compared with RA (p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the HLA-DRB1 allele\&#39;s frequency between sporadic and familial RA. Therefore, familial aggregation was not associated with RA severity.

30732168	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been related to an impairment of the nutritional status. Body mass index (BMI) has been used but questions arise about how to properly evaluate nutritional status in RA patients. Few studies have evaluated it by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.In women with RA, to analyze:Case-control study including 89 women with RA. The control group was composed by 100 patients affected by non-inflammatory rheumatic disorders. Study variables included age, RA duration, history, activity and disability, and in relation to nutritional status: BMI, serum albumin (ALB), whole body DXA assessment, and skeletal muscle index (SMI).Mean age of patients was 62 ± 8 years, mean duration of RA was 14 ± 9 years, mean disease activity score (DAS28) was 3.7 ± 1.4 and mean Health Assessment Questionnaire was 0.88 ± 0.77. BMI was 27.43 ± 5.16 Kg/m in patients and 27.78 ± 3.98 Kg/m in controls (P: ns). ALB was within normal range in all patients.By whole body DXA, RA patients presented a statistically significant lower lean mass in all locations and lower fat mass in limbs than controls. Patients had a redistribution of fat mass to trunk. Lean mass directly correlated with fat mass.Neither BMI nor ALB correlated with DXA parameters.BMI, appendicular lean mass and SMI correlated inversely with disease duration. Trunk lean mass correlated inversely, and fat mass directly, with RA disability parameters.RA patients fulfilled criteria of sarcopenia in 44% of cases versus 19% of controls (P &lt;.001). In RA patients, regarding SMI, BMI showed a high specificity to detect sarcopenia (94% of the patients with low BMI had sarcopenia) but low sensitivity (47% of the patients with normal BMI or overweight had sarcopenia).RA patients have an impairment of nutritional status associated to disease duration that looks like sarcopenia and that is not predicted by BMI.

19579138	Journal Article	To measure levels of soluble tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) receptor type I (sTNFRI) and type II (sTNFRII) in order to correlate them with C-reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and disease activity score (DAS28) in RA patients. We recruited 41 RA patients classified according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and 38 healthy subjects (HS). sTNFRI and sTNFRII were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Clinical activity in RA patients was evaluated using the Disease Activity Score using 28 joint counts (DAS28). The statistical analysis was realized using SPSS version 10.0. Soluble TNFRI and TNFRII levels were higher in RA patients (p = 0.04 and 0.001, respectively) than HS. Serum levels of sTNFRI correlated with sTNFRII (r = 0.699, p &lt; 0.0001). sTNFRII correlated with DAS28 (r = 0.375, p = 0.017), RF (r = 0.505, p = 0.004), and ESR (r = 0.323, p = 0.042). The increased levels of both sTNFRI and sTNFRII suggest a secondary event related to the inflammatory state observed in RA, whereas the correlation of sTNFRII with RF, ESR, and DAS28 reflects the preferential TNFRII shedding induced by TNFalpha. sTNFRII may be useful as an additional inflammatory marker in RA.

17471832	Journal Article	The natural course of rheumatoid arthritis inevitably leads to joint damage and reduced life expectancy. Therefore, active treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is indispensable. Although the etiology still remains unknown resulting in unsuccessful prophylaxis and incurability of rheumatoid arthritis, learning more about its pathophysiology broadens the spectrum of therapeutic possibilities. The aim of treatment is remission of the disease. Current standards of treatment are based on the idea to start aggressive treatment as early as possible to suppress the activity of the disease. This can be achieved by pharmacotherapy and rehabilitation. Physiotherapy is supplementary but there is no room for spa treatment or alternative therapies. Treatment should be introduced immediately because the \&quot;window\&quot; for successful change in the natural course of the disease covers the first three months since onset. Diagnostic difficulties during this period support the idea of \&quot;early arthritis\&quot; and \&quot;early rheumatoid arthritis\&quot;. Glycocorticosteroids at a dose suitable to suppress inflammation represent the first-line treatment. Basic therapy which usually is synonymous for methotrexate 15-25 mg once weekly should be introduced from the 4th month at the latest. In case of methotrexate intolerance, leflunomide is an alternative. Lack of efficacy of monotherapy with these drugs mandates the combination therapy of methotrexate with leflunomide, cyclosporine or sulphasalazine together with hydroxychlorochine. The use of two latter drugs should be limited due to their low efficacy. Patients refractory to combination therapy should be considered as candidates to anticytokine drugs or to lymphocyte B depleting drugs. However, it should be emphasized that their high efficacy is achieved only in combination with full doses of methotrexate. The same rules should be applied to therapeutic decisions in elderly patients and in patients with long history of rheumatoid arthritis. However, lower doses of the drugs should be used at initiation of therapy. Contraindications related to side effects and concomitant diseases should be considered. In these groups, glycocorticosteroids play a more important role and cyclophosphamide is used more frequently. Surgical treatment should be reserved for patients with advanced disease. Total joint replacement is an effective method for large joints. Synovectomy should be done only exceptionally when all options of pharmacotherapy were ineffective.

16834582	Controlled Clinical Trial	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease and has the highest rate of prevalence among rheumatic inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of Benson Relaxation Technique (BRT) combined with medication on disease activity in patients with RA. Following ethical approval, 50 consecutive matched patients were selected and allocated into two groups, either an experimental or a control group. Patients in the experimental group received BRT combined with medication and patients in the control group were given only medication. Clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, anxiety, depression and feeling of well-being were measured before and after intervention to evaluate the effect of BRT. There was a significant difference between the two groups in anxiety, depression and feeling of well-being. Changes in clinical symptoms and laboratory findings were not large enough to be statistically significant between the two groups, but they indicated decline in disease progress. The results demonstrate that BRT can be an effective technique in reducing disease process in patients suffering from RA. However, in order to support the findings of this trial, studies with large sample size and &gt; 8-week intervention are recommended.

16132165	Comparative Study	The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of lumiracoxib compared with placebo and celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Following a 3- to 7-day washout period for previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 1,600 patients aged &gt;or=18 years with primary knee OA were randomized to receive lumiracoxib 200 or 400 mg once daily (o.d.), celecoxib 200 mg o.d. or placebo for 13 weeks. Primary efficacy variables were OA pain intensity in the target knee, patient\&#39;s global assessment of disease activity and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale and total scores at week 13. Secondary variables included OA pain intensity in the target knee and physician\&#39;s and patient\&#39;s global assessments of disease activity by visit. Exploratory analysis of responder rates using the Outcomes Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) criteria was performed. Safety and tolerability were assessed. Lumiracoxib was superior to placebo in all primary and secondary variables and was generally similar to celecoxib. There were no statistically significant differences between the two doses of lumiracoxib. All active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo at weeks 2 and 13 in terms of response to treatment assessed using OMERACT-OARSI criteria. The incidence of adverse events was similar across the groups. Lumiracoxib 200 mg o.d. is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for OA of the knee, providing pain relief and improved functional status with efficacy superior to placebo and similar to celecoxib. Lumiracoxib demonstrated a tolerability profile similar to placebo and celecoxib.

23709375	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease of connective tissue characterized by progressive destructive arthritis associated with deformation and impairment of the function of the motor system. RA patients more often present secondary osteoporosis and increased risk of fractures. The aetiology of the process remains not fully understood. A significant role is played by proinflammatory cytokines being common mediators of both inflammatory processes and bone remodelling. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of activity of the inflammation and of applied therapy on osteogenesis marker concentrations in RA patients. Thirty six female patients with RA, confirmed according to ACR criteria, aged from 35 to 77 years were qualified into the study. A control group included 45 healthy women aged between 34 and 78 years. Clinical evaluation (number of painful and swollen joints, DAS 28) and evaluation of RA laboratory activity (ESR, CRP, blood cell count) and levels of selected bone metabolism markers (osteocalcin, PICP) and serum interleukin 1 levels were performed to carry out the study. X-rays of hands and densitometric scanning of the femoral bone neck and spine were completed in order to assess the advancement of lesions in the bones. Osteocalcin and PICP levels were significantly lower in the RA groups compared to the control group (2.51 ± 0.22 pg/mL vs. 18.65 ± 12.84 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001; 0.292 ± 0.047 pg/mL vs. 0.829 ± 0.263 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively). A statistically significant difference was also observed between the levels of osteocalcin and PICP in both sub-groups of RA patients (DAS28 ≤ 5.1 and DAS28 &gt; 5.1) and the control (osteocalcin 2.48 ± 0.23 pg/mL vs. 18.65 ± 12.84 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001; 2.52 ± 0.22 pg/mL vs. 18.65 ± 12.84 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively and PICP 0.281 ± 0.053 pg/mL vs. 0.829 ± 0.263 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001; 0.298 ± 0.044 pg/mL vs. 0.829 ± 0.263 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001 respectively). No correlation was demonstrated between the levels of selected bone metabolism markers and the therapy with methotrexate or cyclosporine. Analysis of the obtained results confirms the presence of disorders of bone metabolism in RA patients. A chronic inflammatory process favors the development of osteoporosis in RA patients. Reduced levels of bone metabolism markers (osteocalcin, PICP) in the study group, compared to the control, may indicate a reduced pace of osteogenesis in RA patients. No effect of therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporine on bone metabolism in that group of patients was found.

23263548	Clinical Trial	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α (PPARα) agonists, or fibrates, are used in the treatment for dyslipidemia. Experimental data suggest that fibrates have anti-inflammatory properties, and PPARα is essential for the differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) which diminished pool in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) contributes to accelerated atherosclerosis. The data on fibrates\&#39; effects in patients with RA are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in disease activity, inflammatory markers, lipid profile, and circulating EPC in active RA patients treated with fenofibrate. Twenty-seven patients with active RA taking traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were prescribed fenofibrate (145 mg/day) for 3 months. All patients received background traditional DMARDs in stable doses. The outcomes measured were clinical disease activity variables, circulating cytokines, adipokines, lipids, and EPC. Twenty-five patients completed the study. At the end of treatment, there was a significant reduction in DAS28, all individual DAS28 components except tender joint count, the duration of morning stiffness, and in the patient\&#39;s assessment of disease activity. Fifteen (60 %) patients achieved good/moderate EULAR response, while 10 (40 %) patients satisfied ACR20 response criteria. Treatment with fenofibrate resulted in significant decrease in CRP and IL-6 concentrations and improvement in lipid profile. There was no change in the concentrations of circulating EPC. In conclusion, fenofibrate treatment is associated with reduced inflammation and improved lipid profile in RA patients. Large randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm these results and to define the role of fibrates in the treatment for RA.

1784888	Clinical Trial	Ibuprofen (ibu) is a racemic 2-arylpropionic acid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug whose activity is due mainly to the S-enantiomer. So far only the racemic compound is in clinical use. A double-blind randomized trial was carried out for a 2-week period in 50 patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Steinbrocker II-III) to compare the effectiveness and tolerance of S-ibu (400 mg T.I.D.) with that of the racemic compound (600 mg T.I.D.). Ritchie-index, limitation of movement, joint pain on pressure and pain at night decreased significantly in both groups. Due to lack of effectiveness, the dose had to be increased in 3 patients from the S-ibu group as well as in 6 patients from the racemic group resulting in mean daily doses of 1220 mg S-ibuprofen and 1870 mg racemic ibu. No statistically significant difference could be found between both groups concerning efficacy and unwanted effects. Therefore, S-ibu given alone may be advantageous because the metabolic load to the human body is reduced and patients are more likely to comply with drug doses of 1.2 g/day as compared to 1.8 g/day.

15574639	Guideline	Kawasaki disease is an acute self-limited vasculitis of childhood that is characterized by fever, bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, changes in the extremities, rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia develop in approximately 15% to 25% of untreated children and may lead to ischemic heart disease or sudden death. A multidisciplinary committee of experts was convened to revise the American Heart Association recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management of Kawasaki disease. The writing group proposes a new algorithm to aid clinicians in deciding which children with fever for &gt; or =5 days and &lt; or =4 classic criteria should undergo echocardiography [correction], receive intravenous gamma globulin (IVIG) treatment, or both for Kawasaki disease. The writing group reviews the available data regarding the initial treatment for children with acute Kawasaki disease, as well for those who have persistent or recrudescent fever despite initial therapy with IVIG, including IVIG retreatment and treatment with corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists, and abciximab. Long-term management of patients with Kawasaki disease is tailored to the degree of coronary involvement; recommendations regarding antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, physical activity, follow-up assessment, and the appropriate diagnostic procedures to evaluate cardiac disease are classified according to risk strata. Recommendations for the initial evaluation, treatment in the acute phase, and long-term management of patients with Kawasaki disease are intended to assist physicians in understanding the range of acceptable approaches for caring for patients with Kawasaki disease. The ultimate decisions for case management must be made by physicians in light of the particular conditions presented by individual patients.

27281595	Journal Article	The first national audit for rheumatoid and early inflammatory arthritis has benchmarked care for the first 3 months of follow-up activity from first presentation to a rheumatology service. Access to care, management of early rheumatoid arthritis and support for self care were measured against National Institute for Health and Care Excellence quality standards; impact of early arthritis and experience of care were measured using patient-reported outcome and experience measures. The results demonstrate delays in referral and accessing specialist care and the need for service improvement in treating to target, suppression of high levels of disease activity and support for self-care. Improvements in patient-reported outcomes within 3 months and high levels of overall satisfaction were reported but these results were affected by low response rates. This article presents a summary of the national data from the audit and discusses the implications for nursing practice.

23283542	Comparative Study	To investigate patterns of inflammatory MRI pathologies of the fore- and midfoot in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and early RA (ERA) and their changes under therapy. In this prospective study, MRI data of the foot of 39 RA patients (29 female, 10 male; age: 54 ± 13 years; disease duration: 35 ± 37 months; baseline DAS28: 3.0 ± 2.0; medication: 29 DMARD, 1 biological, 9 symptomatic or non-specific treatment) were evaluated for synovitis in 314 joints, bone marrow edema and erosions according to RAMRIS criteria in a total of 585 joints. The change in joint pathology intensity was evaluated on follow-up MRI (time of follow-up: 8 ± 4 months) in 25 patients. Inflammation was generally more frequent in the metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints (221/292; 76 %) than in the proximal metatarsal (47/292; 16 %) and tarsal bones (24/292; 8 %). The overall most frequently involved joints of the foot were MTP 5 (51/292; 18 %) and 1 (49/292; 17 %). Change under therapy was most frequently seen in the MTP 1 joint. Progress of inflammation in the MTP 1 was more frequently found in ERA patients than in patients with established RA (disease duration &gt;12 months) (p = 0.002). In RA, the MTP joints, primarily MTP 5 and 1, are the predominant sites of inflammatory MRI pathologies of the foot. A change of inflammatory activity under therapy can be most frequently noted in the MTP 1 joint. This information might be helpful to improve effectiveness of MRI-controlled therapy approaches and clinical trials.

14697682	Clinical Trial	To compare the clinical effects of laterally wedged insoles and neutrally wedged insoles (used as control) in patients with medial femoro-tibial knee osteoarthritis.  24-month prospective randomized controlled study. Outpatients with painful medial femoro-tibial knee osteoarthritis. Patient\&#39;s overall assessment of disease activity (5 grade scale), WOMAC index subscales and concomitant treatments. Performed as an intention-to-treat analysis, with the last observation carried forward (LOCF). Main symptomatic criterion: Improvement in the patient\&#39;s assessment of activity (defined as a reduction of one grade or more at the end of the study as compared to baseline, and no intra-articular injection or lavage during the 6 months previous to the last visit). Secondary criteria for assessment: (a) Changes in the WOMAC subscales at month 24, and (b) concomitant therapies (analgesics, NSAIDs and intra-articular injections or lavages). Structural criterion: Joint space width (JSW) at the narrowest point. Non-compliance was defined as intermittent or lack of insole fitting at two consecutive visits. Compliance within groups was compared by using a life table analysis technique (Log-Rank). The baseline characteristics of the 156 recruited patients (41 males, 115 females, mean age 64.8 years) were not different in the 2 treatment groups. At year 2, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups concerning the percentages of patients with improvement in both global assessment of disease activity and in WOMAC subscales (pain, stiffness, function). The number of days with NSAIDs intake was lower in the group with laterally wedged insoles than in the neutrally wedged group (71+/-173 days vs. 127+/-193 days, P=0.003, Mann-Whitney test). The mean joint space narrowing rate did not differ between the two groups: 0.21+/-0.59 mm/year in the laterally wedged group vs 0.12+/-0.32 mm/year in the neutrally wedged group. Compliance and tolerance were satisfactory. Compliance was different between the 2 groups at month 24, with a greater frequency of patients who wore insoles permanently in the laterally wedged insole group than in the other group (85.8% vs 71.9%, P=0.023). This study failed to demonstrate a relevant symptomatic and/or structural effect of laterally-wedged insoles in medial femoro-tibial OA. However, the reduced NSAIDs intake and the better compliance in the treatment group are in favor of a beneficial effect of laterally-wedged insoles in medial femoro-tibial OA.

18612923	Journal Article	To determine whether circulating levels of osteopontin (OPN), osteoprotegerin (OPG), total soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (total sRANKL), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) change in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during immunosuppressive therapy. Twenty-five active RA patients were randomized to treatment with either etanercept alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). The treatment response after 16 weeks was assessed using the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Blood samples were taken before the start of and every fourth week during the study. OPN, OPG, and total sRANKL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and hsCRP by highly sensitive turbidometry. At baseline, OPN and hsCRP were significantly (p&lt;0.001) elevated compared to healthy persons. Compared to baseline only hsCRP levels decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05 to p&lt;0.001) in the EULAR responders through the study. OPN remained significantly (p&lt;0.05) elevated at 16 weeks in patients with a low disease activity score (DAS&lt; or =3.2). Total sRANKL increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) from baseline to week 12. No statistically significant changes were observed in the non-responders. Active RA patients showed increased circulating levels of hsCRP and OPN, but only hsCRP decreased during etanercept therapy. Our findings suggest that OPN, OPG, total sRANKL, and hsCRP reflect different aspects of the inflammatory process in RA.

The intensive therapy was followed in all the patients with methotrexate in a dose 10-20 mg/week. One, six and twelve months after treatment patients of group 1 demonstrated a decrease in RA clinical activity and inflammation. In a year remission by ACR criteria was achieved in one-third of the patients. The sychroneous program of intensive therapy is highly effective in RA patients with vasculitis, ineffective standard therapy and corticosteroid dependence.

15751095	Clinical Trial	To investigate the safety and efficacy of a recombinant human anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) receptor monoclonal antibody (MRA) that indirectly inhibits the effects of IL-6 in children with systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) refractory to high-dose, long-term corticosteroids. An individual escalating-dose trial was conducted in 11 children with active systemic-onset JIA who met the inclusion criteria. All were first administered an intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg MRA. Each child without active inflammation was given a second identical dose 2 weeks later and a third identical dose 2 weeks after the second dose. Children with disease flares according to laboratory marker values received a 4-mg/kg dose. Those without disease flares at this dose received a second 4-mg/kg dose 2 weeks later and a third 4-mg/kg dose 2 weeks after the second dose, while those with active inflammation received an additional 3 doses of 8 mg/kg MRA. Efficacy was evaluated every 2 weeks according to responses on the JIA core set of improvement criteria and the results of laboratory tests. MRA abruptly reduced disease activity in 10 of the 11 children, as assessed by the occurrence of febrile episodes, active arthritis, scores on the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire, and levels of acute-phase reactants. However, levels of inflammatory reactants fluctuated until the proper MRA dose for each child was reached. Two weeks after the third fixed dose of MRA, 90.9% of all patients had a 30% improvement response, 90.9% had a 50% improvement response, and 63.6% had a 70% improvement response. MRA treatment of children with active systemic disease results in clinical improvement and in normalized levels of acute-phase reactants. MRA was safe and well tolerated and provided greater clinical benefit than conventional corticosteroids, considering the ill effects of IL-6 and adverse events.

27757177	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disorder with unknown etiology. Atorvastatin is a lipid-lowering agent that affects the inflammatory processes. This study aimed to determine the anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin on the Disease Activity Index and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations in RA patients. This clinical trial was performed on 38 RA patients, who were referred to the Imam Reza and Ghaem Medical Centers of Mashhad, Iran between 2013 and 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: 1) the intervention group, which received 40 mg of atorvastatin, and 2) the control group. Response to treatment and the clinical status of patients were evaluated using the Disease Activity Score (DAS-28) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at weeks zero, four, eight, and twelve, based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR Criteria by two rheumatologists. Disease activity and laboratory parameters, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), DAS-ESR, DAS- hs-CRP, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and liver function test (LFT) were measured in both groups. There was a significant difference in the mean number of swollen joints (p&lt;0.011), ESR (p &lt;0.005), DAS-ESR (P&lt;0.043), LDL (0.036), and HDL (0.016) between the two groups. The changes in trend showed no significant difference in the mean number of tender joints (p =0.38), VAS (p =0.715), CRP (p =0.07), DAS-hs-CRP (p=0.431), total cholesterol (p=0.285), or TG (p =0.331) between the two groups. However, the Disease Activity Index decreased by 48.4% in the intervention group, compared to 35.5% in the control group. As the results indicated, atorvastatin has a positive effect on the course of RA. In fact, atorvastatin, as an anti-inflammatory agent, could significantly influence inflammation in RA patients. Therefore, adding a lipid-lowering agent to standard medications in RA may be warranted and could decrease disease activity. The trial was registered at the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (Website: http://www.irct.ir, Irct ID: IRCT2015122425648N2).

22068002	Journal Article	Treating to target is an established concept in the management of a number of long-term conditions to improve outcomes and prevent disease progression. Treatment targets in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are to control the signs and symptoms of significant inflammatory disease activity, with the ultimate goal of remission from disease. The previous article in this series (Firth, 2011) outlined treating RA to target with conventional disease modifying drugs (DMARDs), including the role of the nurse in assessing disease activity, promoting shared clinical-decision making and monitoring treatment. In recent years, biologic agents have increased the treatment options for RA, but their use is reserved for patients with severe disease activity who fail to respond to treatment with two or more DMARDs. This article outlines the role of biologic therapies in treating RA to target, including eligibility criteria and the role of the nurse in optimizing outcomes.

28251248	Journal Article	To systematically search for the availability of evidence for exercise impacting on sleep for people who have rheumatoid arthritis. Two reviewers independently searched seven electronic databases, identified and extracted relevant studies by applying eligibility criteria. Sources of bias were assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane bias assessment tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for non-RCTs. Data were synthesized using a level of evidence approach. Meta-analyses were deemed to be inappropriate due to the heterogeneity of study designs, measurement tools and interventions. Five studies were included: one RCT; two pilot RCTs and two samples of convenience. A total of 262 people with RA were included. Interventions used were difficult to assess due to the heterogeneity of study designs and the inclusion of two using different types of yoga as an intervention. Different sleep outcome measures were used thus, it was not feasible to pool results. Studies had a high risk of bias. This review could find no consistent or conclusive evidence on whether exercise impacts on sleep in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, therefore no firm conclusions can be made. However, there is some indication that exercise may have positive benefits on sleep in people who have rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies with improved study designs, using subjective and objective measures, are needed.

24786926	Journal Article	The differential diagnosis between rheumatic diseases and infectious conditions is a great challenge in clinical practice. Adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory syndrome that shares several clinical and laboratory variables with sepsis. Interleukin (IL)-18 is overexpressed in AOSD, suggesting a possible role as a disease biomarker. The aim of our study was to detect IL-18 serum levels in a cohort of patients with AOSD and sepsis and to address its possible role as a biomarker for differential diagnosis. A group of unselected patients with AOSD diagnosed according to the Yamaguchi criteria and consecutive patients with sepsis diagnosed according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference criteria were enrolled. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. In the AOSD group, disease activity was assessed by Pouchot\&#39;s and Rau\&#39;s criteria. IL-18 serum levels were detected by ELISA. Thirty-nine patients with AOSD and 18 patients with sepsis were enrolled. Two out of 18 patients with sepsis (11.1%) also fulfilled the Yamaguchi criteria. A significant difference was found in IL-18 serum levels between patients with active and inactive disease (p &lt; 0.001), and it positively correlated with disease activity (p = 0.0003), ferritin serum level (p = 0.016), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 0.041). IL-18 was significantly increased in patients with AOSD when compared with sepsis (p = 0.014). For a cutoff of 148.9 pg/ml, this test had a specificity of 78.3% and a sensitivity of 88.6%. We have demonstrated that IL-18 can be a biomarker for differential diagnosis between AOSD and sepsis.

16877460	Journal Article	The aim of the study was to evaluate the pattern of the lymphoid organization in the synovial tissue of patients affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). A total of 40 JIA patients who underwent synoviectomy or synovial biopsies were enrolled. The mean age at surgery was 15.1 yrs (range 6-30 yrs) and the mean disease duration was 6.7 yrs (range 3 months to 22.2 yrs). Tissue specimens were grouped according to the following criteria: (i) diffuse perivascular infiltrate without lymphoid organization, (ii) T cell-B cell aggregates with or without germinal centre reaction. Synovial tissues from 12 JIA patients did not show any sign of lymphoid organization, whereas 28 patients displayed a variable number of T-B cell aggregates. Typical features consistent with a germinal centre reaction were present in two JIA patients only. Lymphoid organization in JIA patients did not correlate with the duration and severity of the disease or with the degree of synovial inflammation, but did positively correlate with the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies. Moreover, a diffuse lymphocyte infiltration was significantly related to the presence of an acute phase of inflammation and the presence of lymphoid aggregates correlated with the degree of plasma cells infiltration. Lymphoid neogenesis in JIA represents a phase in the immunopathological process that characterize the development of inflammatory synovitis. It is not related to disease activity or severity, but appears to be more frequent in patients with circulating anti-nuclear antibodies.

2256738	Journal Article	An investigation of clinical and laboratory variables which might form the basis for judging disease activity in clinical practice was made by six rheumatologists in a prospective study of up to three years\&#39; duration of 113 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. Decisions to start treatment with slow acting antirheumatic drugs were equated with moments of high disease activity. If treatment with slow acting antirheumatic drugs was not started or if the slow acting antirheumatic drug remained unchanged for at least one year or if treatment was stopped because of disease remission, this was equated with periods of low disease activity. Two groups, one with high and one with low disease activity according to the above criteria, were formed. Factor analysis was performed to enable easy handling of the large number of clinical and laboratory variables without loss of information; this resulted in five factors. Next, discriminant analysis was done to determine to what extent each factor contributed to discrimination between the two groups of differing disease activity. Finally, a multiple regression analysis was carried out to determine which laboratory and clinical variables underlie the factors of the discriminant function, resulting in a \&#39;disease activity score\&#39;. This score consisted of the following variables: Ritchie index, swollen joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and general health, in declining importance. The rheumatologists\&#39; decisions to prescribe slow acting antirheumatic drugs, or not, were mainly based on articular symptoms.

15207950	Clinical Trial	Rheumatoid arthritis is characterised by inflammatory synovitis, articular destruction, and accelerated atherogenesis. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) mediate clinically significant vascular risk reduction in patients without inflammatory disease and might have immunomodulatory function. We postulated that statins might reduce inflammatory factors in rheumatoid arthritis and modify surrogates for vascular risk. 116 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were randomised in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to receive 40 mg atorvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to existing disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy. Patients were followed up over 6 months and disease activity variables and circulating vascular risk factors were measured. Coprimary outcomes were change in disease activity score (DAS28) and proportion meeting EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) response criteria. Analysis was by intention to treat. At 6 months, DAS28 improved significantly on atorvastatin (-0.5, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.25) compared with placebo (0.03, -0.23 to 0.28; difference between groups -0.52, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.17, p=0.004). DAS28 EULAR response was achieved in 18 of 58 (31%) patients allocated atorvastatin compared with six of 58 (10%) allocated placebo (odds ratio 3.9, 95% CI 1.42-10.72, p=0.006). C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate declined by 50% and 28%, respectively, relative to placebo (p&lt;0.0001, p=0.005, respectively). Swollen joint count also fell (-2.69 vs -0.53; mean difference -2.16, 95% CI -3.67 to -0.64, p=0.0058). Adverse events occurred with similar frequency in patients allocated atorvastatin and placebo. These data show that statins can mediate modest but clinically apparent anti-inflammatory effects with modification of vascular risk factors in the context of high-grade autoimmune inflammation.

14551709	Comparative Study	Due to the partial elucidation of the immunopathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases during the last years, clinical rheumatology has made a rapid development, which by the consequent use of immunomodulatory therapies including recombinant proteins (biologicals) led to a significantly ameliorated prognosis of these diseases. On this basis, new research projects are continuously performed in the fields of pathogenesis, new drug development, outcome and therapy studies. New developments of imaging techniques and serologic testing facilitate a better classification and definition of disease activity and remission criteria. The current state of research in the field of rheumatoid arthritis and spondylarthropathies with its clinical consequences is reviewed in this article on the basis of the most recent data available.

23518937	Journal Article	Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most frequent periodic syndrome characterized by recurrent attacks of polyserositis. Heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (h-FABP) is an intracellular molecule engaged in the transport of fatty acids through the myocardial cytoplasm and a rapid marker of myocardial injury. FMF is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by ongoing inflammatory activity. Inflammation also plays an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in some rheumatic diseases. We aimed to investigate markers of atherosclerosis in patients with FMF by the measurement of serum h-FABP and malondialdehyde levels (MDA). Forty consecutive patients with FMF and twenty healthy volunteers were selected to participate in the study. The diagnosis of FMF was based on Tel-Hashomer criteria. Serum h-FABP and MDA levels were determined to examine the association. The mean h-FABP level in FMF patients was significantly higher than the normal population (4.89±0.83 vs. 3.06±2.13 ng/ml, p&lt;0.01). The mean platelet volume was significantly higher in FMF patients than in the normal group (8.87±0.99 vs. 8.22±0.45 fl, p=0.04). Serum MDA levels were the same between the groups (1.08±0.66 vs. 1.08 ± 0.33 nmol/ml, p=0.99). h-FABP and MDA levels were the same in FMF patients with an acute attack and during an attack free period. Our results show that h-FABP increases in patients with FMF. Higher h-FABP levels may lead to increased atherosclerotic propensity in FMF, independent of the oxidative stress status of these patients.

27009826	Journal Article	Altered energy expenditure may contribute to the nutritional complications of RA, metabolic syndrome (MS) and rheumatoid cachexia (RC). The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether the altered resting energy expenditure (REE) and physical activity (PA)-related energy expenditure (EE) are related to the duration of RA and inflammatory activity and nutritional complications in RA. Among patients with well-characterized RA (duration, activity: DAS28 ESR), we measured REE by indirect calorimetry, and PA-EE by actimetry (SenseWear Armband). MS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria and RC from DXA body composition analysis. The relations between the characteristics and nutritional complications, and EE were analysed by linear regression. Fifty-seven patients were included [73% women, age 57 (10) years] with a wide range of disease duration: 3.8 (3.0) years, and DAS28 ESR: 3.9 (1.4). The mean REE was 1486 (256) kcal/day, associated with the DAS28 ESR (β = +0.21, P = 0.02 after adjusting for gender and fat free mass). The prevalence of MS and RC was, respectively, 24 and 18%, and they were unrelated to each other. The patients with MS and/or RC had double the longstanding RA score (P &lt; 0.05), twice the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance values (P = 0.052) and halved levels of PA (P &lt; 0.05 for metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) and number of steps/day). Two modifiable factors were associated with the presence of MS and/or RC: a low level of PA as METs [exp(B) = 0.03, P = 0.009] and the use of glucocorticoids [exp(B) = 4.08, P = 0.046]. Low levels of PA and treatment by glucocorticoids are associated with the nutritional complications of RA, suggesting the potential for therapeutic interventions.

22689317	Comparative Study	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory joint disease affecting children. Even if remission is successfully induced, about half of the patients experience a relapse after stopping anti-inflammatory therapy. The present study investigated whether patients with JIA at risk of relapse can be identified by biomarkers even if clinical signs of disease activity are absent. Patients fulfilling the criteria of inactive disease on medication were included at the time when all medication was withdrawn. The phagocyte activation markers S100A12 and myeloid-related proteins 8/14 (MRP8/14) were compared as well as the acute phase reactant high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) as predictive biomarkers for the risk of a flare within a time frame of 6 months. 35 of 188 enrolled patients experienced a flare within 6 months. Clinical or standard laboratory parameters could not differentiate between patients at risk of relapse and those not at risk. S100A12 and MRP8/14 levels were significantly higher in patients who subsequently developed flares than in patients with stable remission. The best single biomarker for the prediction of flare was S100A12 (HR 2.81). The predictive performance may be improved if a combination with hsCRP is used. Subclinical disease activity may result in unstable remission (ie, a status of clinical but not immunological remission). Biomarkers such as S100A12 and MRP8/14 inform about the activation status of innate immunity at the molecular level and thereby identify patients with unstable remission and an increased risk of relapse.

1092714	Journal Article	Human lysosomes were isolated from normal peripheral blood leukoyctes and characterized by electron microscopy, enzyme analysis, and assays for DNA and RNA. Stored sera from 37 unselected patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), including active and inactive, treated and untreated cases, were tested in complement fixation (CF) reactions with these lysosome preparations. 23 SLE sera exhibited positive CR reactions, as did sera from two patients with \&quot;lupoid\&quot; hepatitis. The seven SLE sera with strongest CF reactivity also demonstrated gel precipitin reactions with lysosomes. Neither CF nor precipitin reactions with lysosomes were observed with normal sera or with sera of patients with drug-induced lupus syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyositis, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. By several criteria the antilysosome CF and precipitin reactions of SLE sera cound not be attributed to antibody to DNA, RNA, or other intracellular organelles. The lysosomal component reactive with SLE sera in CF assays was sedimentable at high speed and is presumably membrane associated. The CF activity of two representative SLE sera was associated with IgG globulins by Sephadex filtration. A search for lysosomal antigen in SLE and related disorders was also made. By employing rabbit antiserum to human lysosomes in immunodiffusion, a soluble lysosomal component, apparently distinct from the sedimentable (membrane-associated) antigen described above, was identified in serum, synovial fluid, or pleural fluid from patients with SLE, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, and leukemoid reaction. An antigenically identical soluble component reactive with the rabbit antiserum could be released in vitro from intact lysosomes by repeated freeze-thaw cycles..

12180720	Clinical Trial	To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor etoricoxib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A double blind, randomized, placebo and active comparator controlled, 12 week study conducted at 88 US sites. Eligible patients were chronic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) users with clinical worsening of RA upon withdrawal of prestudy NSAID. Patients received either placebo, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily, or naproxen 500 mg twice daily (2:2:1 allocation ratio). Primary efficacy measures: patient and investigator global assessments of disease activity and direct assessment of arthritis by counts of tender and swollen joints. Key secondary measures: patient global assessment of pain, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire, and the percentage of patients both completing the study and meeting the ACR20 criteria. Tolerability was assessed by tabulation of adverse events and routine laboratory evaluations. In all, 816 patients were randomized (placebo = 323, etoricoxib = 323, naproxen = 170), and 448 completed 12 weeks of treatment (placebo = 122, etoricoxib = 230, naproxen = 96). Compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving etoricoxib and naproxen showed significant improvements in all efficacy endpoints (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with patients receiving naproxen, patients receiving etoricoxib demonstrated significant improvements (p &lt; 0.05) on all primary endpoints and most other endpoints including ACR20 criteria. The percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response and who completed the study was 21%, 53%, and 39% in the placebo, etoricoxib and naproxen groups, respectively. Etoricoxib and naproxen were both generally well tolerated. In this study, etoricoxib 90 mg once daily was more effective than either placebo or naproxen 500 mg twice daily for treating patients with RA over 12 weeks. Etoricoxib 90 mg was generally well tolerated in patients with RA.

18062805	Journal Article	Clinical practice guidelines have been elaborated to summarize evidence related to the management of knee osteoarthritis and to facilitate uptake of evidence-based knowledge by clinicians. The objectives of the present review were summarizing the recommendations of existing guidelines on knee osteoarthritis, and assessing the quality of the guidelines using a standardized and validated instrument--the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) tool. Internet medical literature databases from 2001 to 2006 were searched for guidelines, with six guidelines being identified. Thirteen clinician researchers participated in the review. Each reviewer was trained in the AGREE instrument. The guidelines were distributed to four groups of three or four reviewers, each group reviewing one guideline with the exception of one group that reviewed two guidelines. One independent evaluator reviewed all guidelines. All guidelines effectively addressed only a minority of AGREE domains. Clarity/presentation was effectively addressed in three out of six guidelines, scope/purpose and rigour of development in two guidelines, editorial independence in one guideline, and stakeholder involvement and applicability in none. The clinical management recommendation tended to be similar among guidelines, although interventions addressed varied. Acetaminophen was recommended for initial pain treatment, combined with exercise and education. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were recommended if acetaminophen failed to control pain, but cautiously because of gastrointestinal risks. Surgery was recommended in the presence of persistent pain and disability. Education and activity management interventions were superficially addressed in most guidelines. Guideline creators should use the AGREE criteria when developing guidelines. Innovative and effective methods of knowledge translation to health professionals are needed.

22150604	Journal Article	To systematically review the evidence available for nonsurgical management of hip dysplasia (HD). Literature review. Databases (Pubmed, Veterinary Information Network) were searched for clinical studies on nonsurgical management of HD in dogs. The evidence in each study was reviewed and assigned a score (I-IV) based on previously reported levels of evidence. Fourteen articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria, including 3 Level IV, 4 Level III, and 7 Level II studies. Methods of nonsurgical management reviewed included: activity restrictions, weight management, acupuncture, modulation of joint disease by polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and extra corporeal shock wave therapy. Weight management is an effective and important component of managing dogs with HD and associated osteoarthritis. Techniques that modulate the progression of joint disease may also be beneficial for treating dogs with HD. Further studies are needed to investigate other methods of managing HD such as hydrotherapy and physical rehabilitation.

2270972	Clinical Trial	Most therapeutic tests of osteoarthritis treatments are assessed by criteria based either on fundamental data or on clinical data, which is often subjective. A quantified analysis of locomotion can be used to determine the spatiotemporal indices (stride length and duration), kinematic indices (walking speed, velocity peak), and symmetry criteria that are relevant to the assessment of locomotor handicaps in patients with osteoarthritis. This study examined the progression of locomotor abilities in 11 subjects aged 49-69 (mean 60.9) years with knee osteoarthritis before and after treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Naproxen sodium (1100 mg) was given once a day for seven days. The condition before and after treatment was evaluated by quantitative analysis of locomotion, estimation of pain on a visual analogue scale, and assessment of the degree of functional disability. Significant improvement in locomotor indices (proportional increase in walking speed 17.8%) and in degree of pain (proportional decrease 27%) as estimated on the analogue scale was found after non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment. The lack of a significant correlation between the decrease in pain experienced by the patients and the objective improvement of their functional capabilities emphasises the need in further studies of new treatments to accompany the patients\&#39; own assessments of self improvement with a quantitative analysis of the way in which they walk.

22647860	Journal Article	This study aimed to evaluate prospectively the influence and the evolution of periodontal disease (PD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients submitted to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Eighteen patients with RA (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria) were assessed for PD before (BL) and after 6 months (6M) of anti-TNF treatment: 15 infliximab, 2 adalimumab, and 1 etanercept. Periodontal assessment included plaque and gingival bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level. Rheumatologic evaluation was performed blinded to the dentist\&#39;s assessment: demographic data, clinical manifestations, and disease activity (Disease Activity Score using 28 joints [DAS28], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). The median age and disease duration of patients with RA were 50 years (25-71 y) and 94% were female. Periodontal disease was diagnosed in 8 patients (44.4%). Comparing BL to 6M, periodontal parameters in the entire group remained stable (P &gt; 0.05) throughout the study (plaque and gingival bleeding indices, probing pocket depth, cementoenamel junction, and clinical attachment level), whereas an improvement in most analyzed RA parameters was observed in the same period: DAS28 (5.5 vs. 3.9, P = 0.02), ESR (21 vs. 12.5 mm/first hour, P = 0.07), and CRP (7.8 vs. 2.8 mg/dL, P = 0.25). Further analysis revealed that this improvement was restricted to the group of patients without PD (DAS28 [5.5 vs. 3.6, P = 0.04], ESR [23.0 vs. 11.5 mm/first hour, P = 0.008], and CRP [7.4 vs. 2.1, P = 0.01]). In contrast, patients with PD had lack of response, with no significant differences in disease activity parameters between BL and 6M: DAS28 (5.2 vs. 4.4, P = 0.11), ESR (17.0 vs. 21.0, P = 0.56), and CRP (9.0 vs. 8.8, P = 0.55). This study supports the notion that PD may affect TNF blocker efficacy in patients with RA. The possibility that a sustained gingival inflammatory state may hamper treatment response in this disease has high clinical interest because this is a treatable condition.

16770616	Journal Article	The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ornidazole in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This was 3 months, randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled study. A total of 160 patients with active RA were randomly assigned to receive 1,000 mg ornidazole (n = 53), 500 mg ornidazole (n = 55), or placebo (n = 52). A significantly greater percentage of patients treated with 1,000 mg ornidazole met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieved an ACR20 response) at 3 months compared with patients who received placebo (62.0 vs. 32.4%; P &lt; 0.001). Greater percentages of patients treated with 1,000 mg ornidazole also achieved ACR50 responses (38.3 vs. 10.9%; P &lt; 0.001) and ACR70 responses (19.6 vs. 1.2%; P &lt; 0.001) compared with patients who received placebo. Ornidazole treatment was also associated with significant reductions in pain and duration of morning stiffness, significant improvement in the quality of life and both the physician\&#39;s and patient\&#39;s global assessments, and significant reductions in disease activity as assessed by objective laboratory measures (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level). Ornidazole was well tolerated. There were no dose-limiting toxic effects. In this 3-month-trial ornidazole was safe, well tolerated, and associated with improvement in the inflammatory symptoms of RA.

22834652	Journal Article	There are few data concerning the impact of inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) on quantitative heel ultrasound (QUS) measurements. The aims of this analysis were i) to determine the influence of IP on QUS measurements at the heel and, ii) among those with IP to determine the influence of disease related factors on these measurements. Men and women aged 16 years and over with recent onset IP were recruited to the Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR). Individuals with an onset of joint symptoms between 1989 and 1999 were included in this analysis. At the baseline visit subjects underwent a standardised interview and clinical examination with blood taken for rheumatoid factor. A population-based prospective study of chronic disease (EPIC-Norfolk) independently recruited men and women aged 40 to 79 years from the same geographic area between 1993 and 1997. At a follow up assessment between 1998 and 2000 subjects in EPIC-Norfolk were invited to have quantitative ultrasound measurements of the heel (CUBA-Clinical) performed. We compared speed of sound (SOS) and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), in those subjects recruited to NOAR who had ultrasound measurements performed (as part of EPIC-Norfolk) subsequent to the onset of joint symptoms with a group of age and sex matched non-IP controls who had participated in EPIC-Norfolk. Fixed effect linear regression was used to explore the influence of IP on the heel ultrasound parameters (SOS and BUA) so the association could be quantified as the mean difference in BUA and SOS between cases and controls. In those with IP, linear regression was used to examine the association between these parameters and disease related factors. 139 men and women with IP and 278 controls (mean age 63.2 years) were studied. Among those with IP, mean BUA was 76.3 dB/MHz and SOS 1621.8 m/s. SOS was lower among those with IP than the controls (difference = -10.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) -17.4, -2.6) though BUA was similar (difference = -1.2; 95% CI -4.5, +2.1). The difference in SOS persisted after adjusting for body mass index and steroid use. Among those with IP, disease activity as determined by the number of swollen joints at baseline, was associated with a lower SOS. In addition SOS was lower in the subgroup that satisfied the 1987 ACR criteria. By contrast, disease duration, steroid use and HAQ score were not associated with either BUA or SOS. In this general population derived cohort of individuals with inflammatory polyarthritis there is evidence from ultrasound of a potentially adverse effect on the skeleton. The effect appears more marked in those with active disease.

11087700	Clinical Trial	Validation of responsiveness and discriminative power of the World Health Organisation/International League of Associations for Rheumatology (WHO/ILAR) core set, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and European League for Rheumatology (EULAR) criteria for improvement/response, and other single and combined measures (indices) in a trial in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Ranking of measures by response (standardised response means and effect sizes) and between-group discrimination (unpaired t test and chi(2) values) at two time points in the COBRA study. This study included 155 patients with early RA randomly allocated to two treatment groups with distinct levels of expected response: combined treatment, high response; sulfasalazine treatment, moderate response. At week 16, standardised response means of core set measures ranged between 0.8 and 3.5 for combined treatment and between 0.4 and 1.2 for sulfasalazine treatment (95% confidence interval +/-0.25). Performance of patient oriented measures (for example, pain, global assessment) was best when the questions were focused on the disease. The most responsive single measure was the patient\&#39;s assessment of change in disease activity, at 3.5. Patient utility, a generic health status measure, was moderately (rating scale) to poorly (standard gamble) responsive. Response means of most indices (combined measures) exceeded 2.0, the simple count of core set measures improved by 20% was most responsive at 4.1. Discrimination performance yielded similar but not identical results: best discrimination between treatment groups was achieved by the EULAR response and ACR improvement criteria (at 20% and other percentage levels), the pooled index, and the disease activity score (DAS), but also by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and grip strength. Responsiveness and discrimination between levels of response are not identical concepts, and need separate study. The WHO/ILAR core set comprises responsive measures that discriminate well between different levels of response in early RA. However, the performance of patient oriented measures is highly dependent on their format. The excellent performance of indices such as the ACR improvement and EULAR response criteria confirms that they are the preferred primary end point in RA clinical trials.

1882189	Journal Article	The synovial fluid in affected joints of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients contains many cells, in numbers strongly correlated with the severity of disease. As the disease worsens and the cell count increases, the polymorphonuclear leucocyte becomes the predominant cell type. Although the inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) have no direct neutrophil-attractant activity, they are both potent inducers of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in a variety of cell types. Chemotactic attraction of neutrophils is a major activity of IL-8. Examination of a number of synovial fluids showed that significant levels of IL-8 are present in a high proportion of RA cases (10 out of 17), at concentrations directly related to the number of cells in the joint, and to circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The cytokine is present only at background levels in other diseases accompanied by arthritic manifestations, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and induced arthritis. The progressive joint destruction seen in all cases where high IL-8 levels were measured, coupled with the neutrophil-rich cell count and the strong correlation between concentration of IL-8 and both serum CRP and cellular influx into the joint, is strongly suggestive of a pathogenic role for IL-8 in RA.

24817165	Journal Article	To investigate the prevalence of lower extremities clinical and radiographic OA in former elite male athletes and referents from the general population and to examine its association with the participants\&#39; demographic characteristics. Two hundred and eighteen former elite male athletes (soccer, volleyball, martial arts, track and field and basketball players, and skiers) and 181 male controls that reported no systematic athletic activity were examined by means of questionnaire, clinical and radiographic evaluation. Exclusion criteria were age younger than 40 years and a positive history of lower extremity surgery, bone or soft tissue trauma and inflammatory arthropathy. Overall, the prevalence of clinical OA between former elite athletes (15.6 %) and controls (14.4 %) was similar (n.s.). The prevalence of radiographic OA was significantly higher (p = 0.03) in former elite athletes (36.6 %) compared with controls (23.9 %). All the participants with clinical OA who underwent radiographic examination also had radiographic OA. The prevalence of clinical and radiographic OA was similar (n.s.) between former athletes of different sports. Age, body mass index (BMI) and occupation variably predicted the prevalence of hip, knee and ankle OA in both study groups. In the absence of major bone and soft tissue lower limb trauma during their athletic career, former elite athletes may not be at increased risk of developing clinical OA. Radiographic signs of OA present at a significantly higher incidence and possibly precede the clinical onset of OA. Age, BMI and occupation are identified as strong predictors of the development of OA in former elite athletes.

26238709	English Abstract	From the perspective of patients with rheumatic diseases, the reduction of inflammatory disease activity alone is not a sufficient treatment goal. In addition the functional health and participation also have to be improved. Starting with the first symptoms the empowerment for the self-management of the disease is important for the patients; therefore, the established treat to target-strategy has to be expanded by the functional dimension to treat to participation. The position paper of the German Society for Rheumatology (GSR) summarizes the relevant fields of the multiprofessional action that is frequently necessary. This includes the acquirement of function-related competencies during training, further education and advanced training as well as implementation in the everyday practice of patient care. Furthermore, the GSR acknowledges the need for research related to functional and sociomedical consequences of rheumatic diseases and to individual and combined function-related programs in outpatient and inpatient care in rheumatology.

29724726	Journal Article	Pain is the predominant symptom for people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) and osteoarthritis (OA) mandating the development of evidence-based recommendations for the health professional\&#39;s approach to pain management. A multidisciplinary task force including professionals and patient representatives conducted a systematic literature review of systematic reviews to evaluate evidence regarding effects on pain of multiple treatment modalities. Overarching principles and recommendations regarding assessment and pain treatment were specified on the basis of reviewed evidence and expert opinion. From 2914 review studies initially identified, 186 met inclusion criteria. The task force emphasised the importance for the health professional to adopt a patient-centred framework within a biopsychosocial perspective, to have sufficient knowledge of IA and OA pathogenesis, and to be able to differentiate localised and generalised pain. Treatment is guided by scientific evidence and the assessment of patient needs, preferences and priorities; pain characteristics; previous and ongoing pain treatments; inflammation and joint damage; and psychological and other pain-related factors. Pain treatment options typically include education complemented by physical activity and exercise, orthotics, psychological and social interventions, sleep hygiene education, weight management, pharmacological and joint-specific treatment options, or interdisciplinary pain management. Effects on pain were most uniformly positive for physical activity and exercise interventions, and for psychological interventions. Effects on pain for educational interventions, orthotics, weight management and multidisciplinary treatment were shown for particular disease groups. Underpinned by available systematic reviews and meta-analyses, these recommendations enable health professionals to provide knowledgeable pain-management support for people with IA and OA.

23836776	Journal Article	To investigate the initial response to treatment and risk of radiographic disease progression in current smokers (S), ex-smokers (EX), and nonsmokers (NS) in a prospective early arthritis cohort and to analyze the influence of smoking cessation on arthritis outcome. The ESPOIR cohort is a prospective cohort study monitoring clinical, biologic, and radiographic data for patients with inflammatory arthritis lasting 6 weeks to 6 months. We examined the influence of smoking status on disease presentation (baseline characteristics) and therapeutic response at 1 year. Risk of structural progression at 12 months, defined as change in the modified Sharp/van der Heijde score ≥1, was analyzed by multivariate regression adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, joint erosion at inclusion, educational level, positivity for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 antibodies, and shared HLA-DRB1 epitope). A total of 813 patients were included; 641 (79%) fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At inclusion, 138 (21.5%) were S patients, 168 (26.2%) were EX patients, and 335 (52.3%) were NS patients. Baseline acute-phase indicator values were significantly lower for S patients than EX and NS patients (mean ± SD erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 24.2 ± 18.2 mm/hour versus 33.4 ± 28.0 and 31.4 ± 25.0 [P = 0.02], respectively, and mean ± SD C-reactive protein level was 17.7 ± 28.0 mg/dl versus 28.5 ± 42.5 and 21.4 ± 29.0 [P = 0.01], respectively). Smoking status had no influence on Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, Health Assessment Questionnaire score, EULAR response, or use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic therapy in the first 12 months of followup (P &gt; 0.05). The adjusted risk for structural disease progression was associated with active smokers (odds ratio 0.50 [95% confidence interval 0.27-0.93], P = 0.028). Sixteen patients had stopped smoking at 12 months, with no significant difference in observed outcomes from other patients. In this large prospective cohort of patients with early arthritis, smoking status had no significant effect on disease activity and disability but did reduce 1-year radiographic disease progression. The antiinflammatory role of nicotine may explain the lower systemic inflammation and structural disease progression in current smokers with early RA.

12043886	Journal Article	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory multisystem disease of unknown etiology with immunologic aberrations. Many studies have shown that genetic and environmental factors are implicated in the development of SLE. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) affects various immune phenomena through the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kininogen systems by creating angiotensin II and inactivating bradykinin. We investigated the correlation between insertion/ deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene and the clinical manifestations of SLE, especially vascular involvement and lupus nephritis. Two-hundred and eleven Korean patients fulfilling the ACR criteria and 114 healthy subjects were enrolled. The ACE genotype was determined by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA from peripheral blood. The nephritis patients were classified by the WHO classification. In addition, the activity and chronicity index were used to assess the severity of renal involvement. We evaluated vascular involvement by the presence or absence of hypertension, Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon, livedo reticularis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody and the SLICC/ACR Damage Index. The gene frequency of ACE gene polymorphism was as follows: II 39 vs 34%, ID 41 vs 50%, DD 20 vs 16% in SLE patients and controls, respectively. There was no difference in genotype frequency between both groups. There were no significant differences between the distribution of ACE gene genotypes and lupus nephritis and its related parameters, including WHO classification, activity index, chronicity index, renal dysfunction and amount of 24 h urinary protein. The ACE genotypes and alleles did not affect the presence of vascular manifestations evaluated, but the frequency of DD genotype was significantly low in SLE patients with Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon compared to those without Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon (P = 0.002 for ACE ID vs DD and II, OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.43-5.09; P=0.023 for ACE DD vs ID and II, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.89). Also skewing from DD to II genotype was noted in patients with anti-Sm antibody compared to those without anti-Sm antibody (P = 0.025 for ACE DD vs ID and II, OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.93). The onset age of serositis was older in patients with the ID genotype than the others (ID= 34.5+/-10.8, II + DD = 25.6+/-10.2, P= 0.002). Also the onset age of malar rash was older in patients with II genotype than the others (II=26.7+/-8.4, ID+DD=21.3+/-9.0; P=0.021). The patients with I allele showed a significantly higher frequency of serositis (P = 0.022). Taken together, the I/D polymorphisms of ACE gene did not affect susceptibility of SLE, lupus nephritis and the vascular manifestations, including Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon, in Korean SLE patients, although the DD genotype was negatively associated with Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon among SLE patients. However, it would be valuable to evaluate the role of other genes potentially related to vascular events, such as endothelin, nitric oxide or angiotensin II receptor as well as ACE gene.

24249648	Journal Article	Prednisone is a well-established treatment option in rheumatoid arthritis. Low-dose glucocorticoid therapy alleviates disease signs and symptoms, is better tolerated than high-dose therapy, and its addition to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) inhibits radiographic disease progression. A low-dose, modified-release (MR) formulation of prednisone, administered in the evening, was developed to counter the circadian rise in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels that contributes to disease activity. In a 12-week, randomized trial (CAPRA-2) in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving stable DMARD therapy, the addition of MR prednisone reduced disease signs and symptoms by ≥20 % according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria (in 48 % of patients vs. 29 % with placebo; p &lt; 0.002 [primary endpoint]). In another 12-week trial (CAPRA-1), addition of evening MR prednisone to stable DMARD therapy reduced the mean duration of morning stiffness to a greater extent than addition of morning immediate-release (IR) prednisone (22.7 vs. 0.4 %; p = 0.045 [primary endpoint]). The improvement in morning stiffness with MR prednisone was maintained for 9-12 months during the open-label extension of CAPRA-1. These findings were supported by data from observational studies in various adult populations with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with evening MR prednisone for up to 12 months was generally well tolerated, with an overall similar tolerability profile compared with evening placebo or morning IR prednisone, and no new safety concerns. MR prednisone was estimated to be cost effective relative to IR prednisone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in a UK pharmacoeconomic model.

29157669	Journal Article	IL-6 contributes significantly to the chronic inflammatory process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Tocilizumab, a humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody that blocks the signaling originated by the IL-6/IL-6R complex, is an effective treatment. However, predictors of the response to tocilizumab are still required. We aimed to combine IL-6 and soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) levels to identify groups of responses. Heparinized blood and clinical data from 63 RA patients were collected before treatment and after 3 and 6 months. Two-step clustering (SPSS v.18) was used to establish the relationship between IL-6 and sIL-6R. Then, we compared European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria with remission achievement in the groups of patients. Three statistical significant clusters of RA patients (i.e., g1, g2, and g3) were defined by serum concentrations of IL-6 and sIL-6R at baseline. All groups of RA patients had higher IL-6 and sIL-6R levels than healthy donors. The levels of IL-6 expressed as median (IQR) in g1 patients were 124(90-183)pg/ml, in g2 12.3(4.4-24)pg/ml, and in g3 60.1(30-146)pg/ml (p &lt; 0.001). The levels of sIL-6R expressed as mean ± sd in g1 patients were 250.5 ± 72ng/ml, in g2 269.1 ± 125ng/ml, and in g3 732.7 ± 243ng/ml (p &lt; 0.001). Disease activity score (DAS)28, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were comparable in the three groups at baseline. Disease duration in g3 was the longest (median(IQR) years: g1 = 11(5-15), g2 = 12(8-20), and g3 23(16-26); p = 0.006), with years of disease evolution being correlated with sIL-6R levels (R = 0.417, p &lt; 0.001). Simple and Clinical Disease Activity Index (SDAI and CDAI) decreased significantly in the three groups. However, EULAR response criteria and remission achievement at 6m was different in the three groups (p = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). In all. 17 out of the 18 patients in g1 had a good or moderate response to tocilizumab. Conversely, the percentage of patients with no response to tocilizumab was higher in g3 than in g1 and g2. We also observed different changing patterns of IL-6 and sIL-6R levels among the three groups. RA patients could be easily stratified prior to therapeutic intervention with two molecules related to the pathway blocked by tocilizumab. G1 patients, who had the best response to tocilizumab, had the highest level of IL-6 and the lowest level of sIL-6R.

15751093	Journal Article	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a progressive disease in which chronic inflammation can lead to extensive new bone formation throughout the spine. At present, few measures of the activity or extent of the disease are available. In this study, we sought to determine whether markers of cartilage synthesis and degradation could provide such quantitative measures. Serum samples from 23 patients receiving infliximab treatment for AS were obtained at baseline and at weeks 2, 6, 14, and 22. Patients were stratified with respect to joint involvement and baseline levels of inflammatory markers, and responders were defined according to the Assessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis 20% criteria. Serial measurements of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and IL-1 were done at each time point. The following biomarkers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay: the proteoglycan aggrecan 846 epitope, a marker of cartilage turnover; C-propeptide of type II collagen (CPII), a biosynthesis marker; and the Col2-3/4(long mono) (C2C) and Col2-3/4(short) (C1-2C) neoepitopes, reflecting collagen cleavage of type II collagen and type I/type II collagen, respectively. At baseline, patients with AS demonstrated significant elevations in serum levels of CPII, the 846 epitope, and the CPII-to-C2C (CPII:C2C) ratio (but not C2C or C1-2C) compared with normal controls. Of the biomarkers examined, only CPII:C2C showed a correlation with the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. Among the biomarker-cytokine relationships, TGFbeta demonstrated a trend toward a positive correlation with the 846 epitope. In AS, elevated serum levels of CPII and the 846 epitope may be related to biosynthetic turnover of hyaline cartilage and the intervertebral discs but may also reflect progressive bone formation as a result of endochondral ossification. The correlation of the CPII:C2C ratio with CRP suggests that the CPII:C2C ratio might prove to be a useful marker of disease activity in AS.

28455366	Journal Article	To investigate the effects of cardiorespiratory and strength exercises on disease activity for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs). A systematic review with meta-analysis registered at PROSPERO (CRD42015020004). Patients with IRDs. The databases MEDLINE, AMED, Embase and CINAHL were searched from inception up to April 2016. Trials were included if they were randomised controlled trials of adults with IRDs, comparing the effect of cardiorespiratory and strength exercises with usual care on disease activity and followed the American College of Sports Medicine\&#39;s exercise recommendations. The primary outcome was disease activity in terms of inflammation, joint damage and symptoms. Data were pooled in a random-effect model for all outcomes, and standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated. The quality of evidence was evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Twenty-six trials with a total of 1286 participants were included. There was high to moderate quality evidence, for a small beneficial effect on disease activity scores (0.19 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.33), p&lt;0.01) and joint damage (SMD 0.27 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.46), p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, moderate quality evidence for a small beneficial effect on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SMD 0.20 (95% CI 0.0 to 0.39), p=0.04) and for no effect on C reactive protein (SMD -0.14 (95% CI -0.37 to 0.08), p=0.21). Beneficial effects were also seen for symptoms. The results of this review suggest beneficial effects of exercises on inflammation, joint damage and symptoms in patients with IRDs.

16911111	Journal Article	To identify a cohort of cats with clinical osteoarthritis and to report on the clinical signs, the frequency of joints affected and the possible aetiopathogenesis within this population. Inclusion criteria for this prospective study were presence of historical evidence and/or clinical signs of osteoarthritis, together with radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. Patients showed clinical improvement within four weeks of analgesic administration and were free from other disease processes, which might explain the clinical signs and/or their response to analgesia. Twenty-eight cases were included in the cohort. The elbow (45 per cent) and the hip (38 per cent) were the most frequently affected joints. Seventy-one per cent of cases had primary/idiopathic aetiology. Alterations in both the ability to jump (71 per cent) and the height (67 per cent) of jump (lifestyle changes) were the most frequent signs of disease. Sixty-one per cent of owners felt that their pet had made a marked improvement following administration of an analgesic/anti-inflammatory drug. There were statistically significant improvements in the ability to jump (P &lt; 0.001), the height of jump (P &lt; 0.001), lameness (P = 0.03), stiff gait (P = 0.04) and the activity level (P = 0.02) when compared with the start and the end of the study period. Osteoarthritis is a clinical problem in cats, but overt lameness is not the most common clinical feature.

29600948	Journal Article	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic rheumatic disease in children, with heterogeneous clinical features. Although therapeutic options are wide and in the majority of children symptoms improve with the combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying drugs, there are a number of patients who do not respond to conventional therapy and who do not meet the criteria for systemic biologics, namely anti TNF-alpha. Those patients are potential candidates for intraarticular therapy with biologics and in this report we present the results of intra-articular infliximab treatment in a series of patients diagnosed with oligoarticular subtype of JIA. Twenty patients (30 joints) were treated with intraarticular infliximab and monitored by power Doppler musculoskeletal ultrasound according to the OMERACT and Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS 10) before intraarticular application and during the follow-up period of 18 months (0, 1, 12, 18 months). The results showed statistically significant improvement in PD-MSUS measures and JADAS in both B mode and power Doppler mode scores (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively) in patients treated with i.a. infliximab with persistent response in fifteen patients. The JADAS score, as well as the ultrasound scores, were significantly reduced during the follow-up period. This study showed promising results, good safety and potential for the clinical benefit of intraarticular infliximab treatment in a selected group of patients with oligoarticular subtype of JIA.

17216021	Journal Article	The fundamental role of Vitamin D has been long known in regulating calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. An increased contribution of Vitamin D was recently described in association with a lower incidence of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). This must not be surprising, as the immunomodulating effects of Vitamin D are clear, which have been attributed protective effects in autoimmune disorders such as some chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes. An interaction was suggested between Vitamin D metabolism and inflammation indexes through mediation of TNF-alpha which is also especially involved in osteoclastic resorption and therefore in bone loss processes. Some preliminary data would indicate an association between seasonal changes of Vitamin D serum levels, latitude and disease activity (DAS28) in RA patients. Consequently, the Osteoporosis and Metabolic Bone Diseases Study Group of SIR believes that there are grounded reasons for assessing the Vitamin D status of RA patients in order to investigate whether this is to be related to physiopathological and clinical aspects of disease other than those of bone involvement. Primary end point of the study will be to assess the levels of 25 OH Vitamin D in RA patients. Secondary endpoints will include correlation with dis-ease activity, densitometry values and bone turnover. The cross-sectional study will enroll patients of both sex genders, age ranging between 30 and 75 years according to the 1988 ACR criteria, onset of symptoms at least 2 years prior to study enrollment. Patients will be excluded suffering from osteo-metabolic diseases, liver and kidney insufficiency and those administered Vitamin D boli in the previous 12 months. Disease activity will be evaluated with the HAQ. Hemato-chemical tests and femoral and lumbar bone densitometry will be performed, unless recently undergone by patients. Blood levels of 25 OH C Vitamin D and PHT and of the two bone remodelling markers (bone alkaline phosphatase and serum CTX) will be measured, as well. Patient enrollment will start on February 2007 and will last 4 months. By the end of 2007 the study will be concluded and results will be published.

27633820	Journal Article	Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is the second most frequent inflammatory rheumatic disease, characterized by spinal involvement, peripheral arthritis, or enthesitis with marked pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Fibromyalgia (FM) may be associated with SpA, and shares some common symptoms. We aimed to determine how FM influences assessment of SpA disease activity, which is mainly dependent on patient-based outcome measures such as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). This single-center cross-sectional study included consecutive patients with SpA according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria. FM was diagnosed according to the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Patient characteristics, BASDAI, ASDAS/C-reactive protein (CRP), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire were recorded and compared. The study included 103 patients with SpA; 81 with axial and 22 with peripheral forms. Eighteen patients presented with concomitant FM, of whom 12 had axial SpA and 6 peripheral SpA. Demographic characteristics did not differ except for sex, with a female predominance in the FM group that was more marked in peripheral forms. BASDAI was higher in patients with FM [median (IQR): 4.2 (4.2) vs 2.2 (3.1); p = 0.0068], whereas ASDAS-CRP was not significantly different [median (IQR): 2.7 (2) vs 2 (1.3); p = 0.1264]. Nevertheless, median ASDAS-CRP corresponded to high disease activity in patients with SpA or FM compared with moderate activity in non-FM patients. FM is a frequent comorbidity in patients with SpA, especially in peripheral forms. In patients with SpA-FM, disease activity may be overestimated when measured by BASDAI and to a lesser extent by ASDAS-CRP, and this overestimation could lead to inappropriate treatment escalation.

26211456	Journal Article	To examine bone mineral density (BMD) in the spines of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and to identify the main predictors of spine BMD. 160 patients with JIA (82 female, 78 male; median age, 8.7±3.9 years (range, 2.2-18.2 years)) who fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria were enrolled. All subjects underwent an initial dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan of the lumbar spine, while 114 and 87 patients underwent a second and third scan, respectively. The data were compared with those obtained for 114 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. The DXA scans revealed that the JIA patients had a significant spine BMD deficit compared with control subjects (p&lt;0.001). Longitudinal comparison of patients revealed no significant short-term improvement in the spine BMD. Spine BMD correlated with the age (p&lt;0.05), subtype (p&lt;0.05), and disease activity (p&lt;0.01), BMI (p=0.001), glucocorticoid (GC) exposure (p&lt; 0.05), methotrexate (MTX) therapy (p&lt;0.05), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) (p&lt;0.05), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p&lt;0.01), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p&lt;0.01).

21188453	Clinical Trial	In this study, we enrolled early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients at multiple institutes who fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association 1987 revised criteria for the classification of RA, and followed the clinical results of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment prospectively. With the aim of developing therapeutic guidelines using the disease activity score 28 (DAS28) as disease indices, we investigated the usefulness of bucillamine (BUC), one of the most widely used DMARDs in Japan. Eighty-one patients with early RA who had not previously been treated with DMARDs were suitable for BUC therapy as first-choice treatment. After 24 months of treatment, at least moderate improvement was seen in 87.5% of patients using the DAS28 erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). After 24 months of BUC therapy, 7 patients (43.8%) met the remission criterion of DAS28 (ESR) &lt;2.6. The 24-month BUC continuation rate was 60.5% (49/81, monotherapy + combination therapy), of which 59.2% (29/49) were on BUC monotherapy. From the efficacy and safety viewpoints alike, BUC was useful as first-choice treatment for early RA.

20047979	Journal Article	To investigate the accuracy of composite scores in classifying RA patients who are in remission using the absence of inflammatory activity detected by ultrasound (US) as a gold standard. Ninety-seven RA patients who were classified by their rheumatologists as being in remission were studied. Disease activity was assessed by the DAS-28 and simplified disease activity index (SDAI). US examination was performed in mode B and power Doppler (PD) in 42 joints. Synovial hypertrophy (SH) and PD were present in 92 (94.8%) and 41 (42.3%) patients. If we consider \&#39;remission\&#39; to be the absence of joints with PD signal, no differences were found by DAS-28 between patients in remission and those not in remission, although differences were present by SDAI. We then calculated the sensitivity (S), specificity (Sp) and positive likelihood ratio (LR) of different SDAI cut-off points to predict absence of PD signal. SDAI &lt; 5 had an S of 65% (95% CI 52, 76), Sp of 55% (95% CI 39, 69) and LR of 1.45 (95% CI 0.98, 2.15), whereas SDAI &lt; 3.3 had an S of 57% (95% CI 44, 69), Sp of 74% (95% CI 58, 85) and LR of 2.24 (95% CI 1.25, 4.01). Our results suggest that the SDAI classification of remission is closer to the concept of an absence of inflammatory activity, as defined by the absence of positive PD signal by US.

636666	Journal Article	The photometric latex test (PLT) for the detection of rheumatoid factors has been clinically evaluated. PLT titers have been closely studied in relation to clinical and laboratory parameters by means of parametric and nonparametric statistical methods. An analysis of the sensitized sheep cell test (SSC) titers has also been undertaken. The subjects comprised 377 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 120 controls. The medical data recorded included sex, age, diagnosis, anatomical stage, functional class, duration and course of the disease, presence of the American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria, blood sedimentation rate, red and white blood counts, haemoglobin concentration, total protein content, serum protein levels, and SSC and PLT titers. A multivariate stepwise regression analysis with eight normally distributed variables was made. In accordance with previous findings, a significant correlation was shown to exist between the serum protein levels and the development of the RA when the anatomical stage, functional class and course of the disease were used as parameters of disease activity. In the RA patients there was also correlation between the serologic titers and the serum protein levels, and the anatomical stage, functional class and course of the disease, and the sedimentation rate, thus showing that titers can also serve as a measure of the inflammatory process. There was a significant correlation between the number of ARA criteria and the titers in the RA patients but not in the controls. The course of the disease correlated with the serum titers and other inflammatory parameters, a finding showing that the course of the disease is an important diagnostic parameter with possible prognostic value. Correlation was also demonstrated between the white blood count and the titers. It is concluded that the sedimentation rate, albumin and gamma-globulin levels, and PLT titer are the best parameters of disease activity. The titer values are not only of diagnostic importance but have prognostic value as regards the severity of the disease.

28698330	Journal Article	Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a heterogeneous spectrum of rheumatic diseases with either predominantly axial inflammatory symptoms of the spine and sacroiliac joints or predominantly peripheral arthritis. The two main entities of axial SpA (axSpA) are ankylosing spondylitis or non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA). Tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitors have revolutionised the treatment of patients with axSpA who failed to respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and physical therapy. Chronic pain is common in patients with SpA and may still persist despite the lack of signs of inflammation. This has led researchers to hypothesise that central pain sensitisation may play a role in the generation of chronic pain in SpA. The painDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ) is a screening tool developed to detect neuropathic pain components. The primary objective is to explore the prognostic value of the PDQ regarding treatment response in patients with axSpA 3 months after initiating a biological agent. Secondary aim is to evaluate the impact of extra-articular manifestations, comorbidities and patient-reported outcomes and elucidate if these factors influence treatment response. We will include 60 participants (≥18 years of age) diagnosed with axSpA independent of main entity, who initiate or switch treatment of a biologic. Data will be collected at baseline and at endpoint following Danish clinical practice (≥3 months) of treatment with biologics. We will explore whether the PDQ and other phenotypical patient characteristics are prognostically important for response to biological therapy according to established response criteria like 50% improvement in the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (50%) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score. The study is approved by the Region of Southern Denmark\&#39;s Ethics committee (S-20160094) and has been designed in cooperation with patient representatives. The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02948608, pre-results). Dissemination will occur through publication(s) in international peer-reviewed journal(s).

21271796	Evaluation Studies	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, progressive, inflammatory disorder. The primary goals of treatment in RA are to reduce the signs and symptoms of disease, prevent progression of joint damage and improve patients\&#39; physical function. Patients with different sociodemographic characteristics, varying degrees of severity of illness, and comorbidities tend to exhibit differential response to treatment. The purpose of this review was to identify a broad set of factors that are associated with and/or predictive of RA treatment response and determine those that warrant further research. A comprehensive review of the literature from the last 10 years was performed using three key databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane). All relevant articles that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected and scored for their levels of evidence using the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) scoring method. Data on study design, interventions and treatment outcomes were abstracted using a structured abstraction table. A total of 30 articles were included in the review and data abstraction. Besides gender, baseline clinical variables such as C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, measures of disease activity, and Health Assessment Questionnaire scores (based on five patient-centered dimensions) were consistently associated with treatment response over time. This comprehensive literature review identified several factors associated with treatment response which might be valuable to include as relevant measures in future studies of RA treatment. Inclusion of these factors, particularly those in the clinical and sociodemographic domains, in the design of future trials will further the understanding that ultimately may help clinicians deliver targeted treatment to community practice RA patients, thus resulting in improved patient outcomes.

18425920	Journal Article	Gout is one of the most frequently occurring rheumatic diseases, worldwide. Given the well-known drawbacks of the regular treatments for acute gout (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine), systemic corticosteroids might be safe alternatives. To assess the efficacy and safety of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of acute gout in comparison with placebo, NSAIDs, colchicine, other active drugs, other therapies, or no therapy. Searches were done in the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007); MEDLINE (1966 to 2007) through PubMed; EMBASE (1974 to 2007); Web of Science (1975 to 2007); LILACS (1986 to 2007); and databases of ongoing trials (up to April 2007). Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials investigating the use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of acute gout were included. Two review authors decided independently which trials to include. The same review authors also collected the data in a standardised form and assessed the methodological quality of the trial using validated criteria. When possible, continuous and dichotomous data were summarised statistically. Three head to head trials involving 148 patients (74 systemic corticosteroids; 74 comparator drugs) were included. Placebo-controlled trials were not found. In the studies, different kinds of systemic corticosteroids and different kinds of control drugs were used, both administered in different routes. Intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide was compared respectively to oral indomethacine, and intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); oral prednisolone (together with a single intramuscular diclophenac injection) was compared to oral indomethacine (together with a single placebo injection). Outcome measurements varied: average number of days until total relief of signs, mean decrease of pain per unit of time in mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS) - during rest and activity. In the triamcinolone-indomethacine trial the clinical joint status was used as an additional outcome. Clinically relevant differences between the studied systemic corticosteroids and the comparator drugs were not found; important safety problems attributable to the used corticosteroids were not reported. The quality of the three studies was graded as very low to moderate. Statistical pooling of results was not possible. There is inconclusive evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of acute gout. Patients with gout did not report serious adverse effects from systemic corticosteroids, when used short term.

19821401	Journal Article	Abatacept inhibits the co-stimulation of T cells and disrupts the inflammatory chain of events that leads to joint inflammation, pain, and damage in rheumatoid arthritis. To assess the efficacy and safety of abatacept in reducing disease activity, pain, and improving function in people with rheumatoid arthritis. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), ACP Journal Club (from 2000), and Biosis Previews (from 1990) in March 2007 and December 2008. We contacted authors of included studies and the abatacept manufacturer. Randomized controlled trials comparing abatacept alone, or in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologics, to placebo or other DMARDs or biologics in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Two authors independently assessed search results and risk of bias, and extracted data. We obtained adverse event data from trials, long-term extension studies, and regulatory agencies. Seven trials with 2908 patients were included. Compared with placebo, patients in the abatacept group were 2.2 times more likely to achieve an ACR 50 response at one year (RR 2.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 2.82) with a 21% (95% CI 16% to 27%) absolute risk difference between groups. The number needed to treat to achieve an ACR 50 response was 5 (95% CI 4 to 7). Significant improvements in physical function and a reduction in disease activity and pain were found in abatacept-treated patients compared to placebo. One RCT found abatacept significantly slowed the radiographic progression of joint damage at 12 months compared to placebo, although it is not clear what the clinical relevance of this difference may be. There may be a risk of attrition bias. Total adverse events were greater in the abatacept group (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.08). Other harm outcomes were not significant with the exception of a greater number of serious infections at 12 months in the abatacept group (Peto odds ratio 1.91 (95% CI 1.07 to 3.42). Serious adverse events were increased when abatacept was given in combination with other biologics (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.62). There is moderate-level evidence that abatacept is efficacious and safe in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Abatacept should not be used in combination with other biologics to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The withdrawal and toxicity profile appears acceptable at the present time but further long-term studies and post-marketing surveillance are required to assess harms and sustained efficacy.

11138333	Journal Article	To determine the relationship between serum G-CSF, RA disease activity and the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Sixty-one patients (5 men and 56 women; mean age; 56.1 +/- 11.4 [+/- SD] years, range, 22-70 years) who were selected at random and met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA were examined. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels in sera and synovial fluid were measured by solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA). We also measured various indices of RA disease activity and serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by ELISA. The morning stiffness, number of tender or swollen joints, ESR, Lansbury index and serum G-CSF levels in patients with active RA were significantly higher than the corresponding levels in patients with inactive RA. Serum G-CSF levels correlated significantly with morning stiffness, the number of tender or swollen joints and the Lansbury index. However, there was no correlation between serum G-CSF and ESR. High levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were detected in RA patients. The number of tender or swollen joints, ESR, Lansbury index, and IL-1 beta were significantly higher in G-CSF-positive RA patients than in G-CSF-negative RA patients. Our results suggest that G-CSF produced by synovial cells stimulated by inflammatory cytokines might contribute to inflammatory arthritis in RA patients.

24084416	Journal Article	One of the objectives of the Professional Practice Committee (PPC) of the Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) Section of the Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS) is the development of the field of competence of PRM physicians in Europe. To achieve this objective, UEMS PRM Section PPC has adopted a systematic action plan of preparing a series of papers describing the role of PRM physicians in a number of disabling health conditions, based on the evidence of effectiveness of the PRM interventions. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and the major cause of musculoskeletal pain and limited mobility in the elderly in the world. Therefore, proper management of persons with OA is of substantial importance. The goal of OA management is to reduce the impact of OA on the individual by reducing pain and improving function, activities and participation. The aim of this paper is to descibe the explicit role of PRM physicians in providing management for persons with OA. The optimal management of OA requires the combination of both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches, an issue most of the main guidelines on the evidence-based management of OA share in common. There is good level of evidence about the effectiveness of PRM interventions in the management of OA: high level of evidence about the effect of education, weight reduction and exercise and growing evidence about the effectiveness of physical agent modalities. PRM specialists are involved not only in diagnosis and medical and physical treatments of OA, but, as a rehabilitation strategy, they also deal with the problems of the person focusing on the improvement of all components of human functioning as defined in the ICF including personal and environmental factors with a holistic approach. ICF core sets for OA serve as excellent models for directing proper assessments as well as targeting interventions. PRM specialists well meet the needs of people with OA from the early stages of the disease to the stage of disability that could cause activity limitations and participation restrictions. In conclusion, PRM specialists can make substantial contributions to providing management of OA in order to improve the functioning of individuals with OA from both personal and societal perspective.

26156560	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by an increase in some autoantibodies and proteolytic enzymes, leading to joint destruction. Although recent investigations have considered vitamin K as an anti-inflammatory nutrient with an important role in bone metabolism, there is currently limited information on its efficacy in RA. We aimed to examine the effects of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) on the biomarker of joint destruction and autoantibody in patients with RA. This was a randomized clinical trial in which 64 women with RA who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. Vitamin K1 or placebo was administered to the participants for 8 weeks. Baseline characteristics and anthropometric measures were obtained. Clinical status using disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS-28), serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and rheumatoid factor (RF) were assessed before and after the intervention. The serum level of MMP-3 compared with the baseline values did not change significantly in the groups. However, the serum concentration of RF decreased significantly in the vitamin K1 group (p = 0.041). Intergroup comparison showed no significant change in RF serum level after adjusting for relevant confounders (p &gt; 0.05). Vitamin K1 supplementation at 10 mg/day for 8 weeks did not alter joint destruction and immune status in the patients with RA compared with the controls.

21439251	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory condition that typically causes a symmetrical chronic arthritis. Timely use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) is an essential aspect of disease management, but many patients may not respond even when conventional agents are used optimally. To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adalimumab (ADA), etanercept (ETN), infliximab (IFX), rituximab (RTX) and abatacept (ABT) when used in patients with RA who have tried conventional agents and have failed to improve after trying a first tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. A systematic review of primary studies was undertaken. Databases searched included the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE up to July 2009. Two reviewers assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, obtained the full text of relevant papers and screened them against inclusion criteria. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The quality of included studies was assessed independently by two reviewers, with any disagreements resolved by discussion and consultation with a third reviewer if necessary. Thirty-five studies were included in the systematic review: five randomised controlled trials (RCTs), one comparative study, one controlled study and 28 uncontrolled studies. One RCT (REFLEX) demonstrated the effectiveness of RTX. At 6 months significantly more patients treated with RTX achieved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 [relative risk (RR) = 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.08 to 3.91] and ACR70 (RR = 12.14, 95% CI 2.96 to 49.86) compared with those treated with the placebo. Differences between groups in favour of RTX were observed at 6 months for mean change from baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) (mean difference -1.50, 95% CI -1.74 to -1.26) and mean change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score (mean difference -0.30, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.20). One RCT (ATTAIN) demonstrated the effectiveness of ABT. At 6 months significantly more patients treated with ABT achieved ACR20 (RR = 2.56, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.69) and ACR70 (RR = 6.70, 95% CI 1.62 to 27.80) compared with those treated with placebo. Significant differences between groups in favour of ABT were observed at 6 months for mean change from baseline in DAS28 score (mean difference -1.27, 95% CI -1.62 to -0.93) and mean change from baseline in HAQ score (mean difference -0.34). Twenty-eight uncontrolled studies observed improvement of effectiveness compared with before switching, in patients who switched to ADA, ETN or IFX after discontinued previous TNF inhibitor(s). Four studies were included in the systematic review of cost-effectiveness. Independent economic evaluation undertaken by the assessment group showed that compared with DMARDs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were £34,300 [per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)] for ADA, £38,800 for ETN, £36,200 for IFX, £21,200 for RTX and £38,600 for ABT. RTX dominates the TNF inhibitors and the ICER for ABT compared with RTX is over £100,000 (per QALY). Paucity of evidence from RCTs for assessing the clinical effectiveness of TNF inhibitors and an absence of head-to-head trials comparing the five technologies. Evidence from RCTs suggests that RTX and ABT are more effective than supportive care. Data from observational studies suggest that the use of an alternative TNF inhibitor in patients who exhibit an inadequate response to a first TNF inhibitor may offer some benefit, but there remain uncertainties with regard to the magnitude of treatment effects and their cost-effectiveness. Future research should include head-to-head trials comparing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the technologies against each other and emerging biologics. This study was funded by the Health Technology Assessment programme of the National Institute for Health Research.

22467922	Clinical Trial	Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are proinflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory response. Effective TNF-α blocker treatment is associated with an increase in circulating myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), suggesting their release from inflamed synovium. Currently, in vivo effects of IL-6 inhibition on DC are unknown. We monitored the changes in circulating mDC and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) during tocilizumab (TCZ) therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). DC subset levels were evaluated by flow cytometry in patients with RA (n = 43) and in healthy volunteers (n = 20). In patients with RA, these levels were measured before and during TCZ therapy (8 mg/kg every 4 weeks). Response to TCZ therapy was evaluated at 12 weeks. Statistical analysis was based on Mann-Whitney U tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. At baseline, patients with active RA were characterized by a significantly lower level of circulating mDC and pDC compared to healthy donors. However, this difference did not correlate with any disease activity score. TCZ-treated patients who met the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria at Week 12 had significant reductions in mDC and monocyte levels as compared with EULAR nonresponders. Levels of pDC, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells remained stable during the TCZ courses, regardless of treatment response. Our study reveals an unexpected reduction of circulating mDC and monocytes in patients with RA in response to TCZ therapy. In accord with reports on neutrophils and platelets decreasing during TCZ therapy, our data suggest an effect of IL-6 inhibition on cells from myeloid lineage.

26729950	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by symmetric peripheral polyarthritis, inflammatory synovitis, and articular destruction. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitors, mediate significant vascular risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease by promoting reduction in plasma levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. Extensive in vitro data, experimental studies and more recently few clinical trials have strongly suggested statins to possess an important role in RA mainly mediated by their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of adjunct statin therapy in comparison to standard disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) therapy in patients with RA. In this observational study, diagnosed RA patients of age group between 40 and 60 years were selected as per the inclusion criteria from the rheumatology outdoor. From the selected patients, we identified two separate groups of patients. Group 1 included 30 patients of RA currently under DMARD therapy with adjunct statin medication. Group 2 included 30 patients of RA currently under DMARD therapy. Patients were followed up over 6 months. Standard parameters such as disease activity score (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded for comparing the outcome of RA in both groups. Out of a total of 60 patients who took part in the study, significant beneficial role of adjunct statin medication was found in this study when prescribed along with conventional DMARDs in active RA patients. The mean DAS28, considered by far as the most important index of clinical disease activity in RA, was found to be significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the adjunct statin-treated group (group 1) than that of the conventional DMARD treated group (group 2) after 6 months of continuous therapy. Other two important biochemical markers of RA disease activity, that is, ESR and CRP were also found to be significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in RA patients who were on adjunct statin medication (group 1) than in group 2 comprising RA patients only under conventional DMARDs therapy without statin medication. The results suggest an adjunct and potentially beneficial role of statin therapy in active cases of RA, producing significant clinical and biochemical improvement.

19440813	Clinical Trial	The aim was to determine the efficacy of low-dose intermittent pulse administration of mizoribine (MZR), a purine synthesis inhibitor, in combination with methotrexate (MTX) to control the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with an insufficient clinical response to MTX alone. Twenty-seven patients with active RA, despite treatment with MTX, were enrolled and given MZR in combination with MTX and continued for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was assessment of clinical improvements using the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. Administering MZR to RA patients with an insufficient response to MTX produced significant improvements in the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) after 8-24 weeks. In addition, after 24 weeks, 60.0% and 8.0% of patients had achieved moderate and good responses, respectively, and there were significant reductions in Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 levels. The present preliminary study suggests that low-dose MZR in combination with MTX is well tolerated and provides both clinical and economic benefits.

30318016	Case Reports	Lymphadenopathy is not an uncommon presentation of adult onset Still\&#39;s disease: it is present in up to two thirds of patients with adult onset Still\&#39;s disease. The characteristic appearance of lymphadenopathy is described as intense, paracortical immunoblastic hyperplasia. Changes in light microscopy may resemble lymphoma, but immunohistochemistry reveals a benign polyclonal B cell hyperplasia. We describe a 67-year-old Sri Lankan woman who manifested relapsing prolonged fever, raised inflammatory markers, arthralgia, myalgia, transient skin rash, and cervical lymphadenopathy histologically characterized by noncaseating granulomatous adenitis with central suppuration. Due to the fact of high prevalence of tuberculosis in the region, an extensive diagnostic evaluation was done to exclude the possibility of extrapulmonary tuberculosis; unsuccessful therapeutic trials of complete antituberculosis regime reliably excluded the possibility of tuberculosis and strengthened the diagnostic validity. Disease flares were characterized by systemic inflammatory response syndrome with immediate clinical and laboratory response to corticosteroids. After systematic diagnostic workup which ruled out possible malignant, rheumatic, or autoimmune diseases and infections previously described as causes of granulomatous adenitis, our patient was diagnosed as having adult onset Still\&#39;s disease based on Yamaguchi criteria. She required a trial of indomethacin followed by methylprednisolone pulse therapy and long-term maintenance steroid therapy without steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. She achieved full disease remission in 3 months. Reevaluation after 6 months and 1 year did not reveal residual disease activity. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of suppurative noncaseating granulomatous lymphadenitis attributed to adult onset Still\&#39;s disease among Asian or South Asian ethnicities and it is also rarely reported among Europeans and North Americans. It is an extremely challenging situation to diagnose Still\&#39;s disease with granulomatous lymphadenitis where tuberculosis is highly prevalent. This case highlights the importance of consideration of adult onset Still\&#39;s disease as a potential diagnosis in a compatible clinical context in the presence of noncaseating granulomatous adenitis and indicates that one should not be misled into a diagnosis of tuberculosis by the fact of the high prevalence of tuberculosis, however, the exclusion of other diagnoses is a prerequisite.

10871971	Clinical Trial	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). It is not known whether a specific inhibitor of COX-2 will provide efficacy in osteoarthritis (OA) comparable with NSAIDs. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and safety of the rofecoxib, which specifically inhibits COX-2, with those of the NSAID ibuprofen in patients with OA. To compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability of rofecoxib (12.5 and 25 mg once daily) with ibuprofen (800 mg 3 times daily). A randomized, double-blind trial of 809 adults with OA was conducted. Patients with OA in whom the knee or hip was the primary source of pain were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups on demonstration of disease activity: placebo; rofecoxib, 12.5 or 25 mg once daily; or ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily. Clinical efficacy and safety were monitored during a 6-week treatment period. Both doses of rofecoxib demonstrated efficacy clinically comparable with ibuprofen as assessed by 3 primary end points (pain walking on a flat surface [Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index], patient global assessment of response to therapy, and investigator global assessment of disease status) according to predefined comparability criteria. Both rofecoxib doses and the ibuprofen dose provided significantly (P&lt;.001) greater efficacy than placebo on all primary end points. Results from secondary end points were consistent with those of the primary end points. All treatments were well tolerated; the overall incidence rates of clinical adverse experiences were not significantly different (P&gt;.05) among the treatment groups. Rofecoxib was well tolerated and provided clinical efficacy comparable with a high dose of the NSAID ibuprofen.

28646319	Journal Article	Musculoskeletal findings in Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome are arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, myositis, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue. Enthesis zones are important in the formation of pain in the musculoskeletal system. Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) may show subclinical enthesitis in the synovial joints and in the axial skeleton before joint swelling in inflammatory diseases characterized by arthritis. In this study, we aimed to determine the presence of enthesopathy using the Madrid sonographic enthesitis index (MASEI) in patients with primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (PSS). Consecutive patients with PSS and age-matched healthy controls were included in this study. All the patients met the 2002 American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism classification criteria for PSS. The demographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. Six enthesis sites were evaluated using gray-scale and Doppler US with a linear transducer, and they were scored using the MASEI. They were assessed by the EULAR Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI). We evaluated 40 patients with PSS (average age 48.67 ± 11.23 years) and 30 healthy controls (average age 45.40 ± 8.24 years). Patients with PSS had significantly higher MASEI scores than the healthy controls. Plantar fascia, Achilles tendon, and distal patellar tendons were significantly thicker in the PSS group than in the healthy controls. The MASEI total score had a positive correlation with age. There was no correlation between MASEI total score and BMI and ESSDAI. In this study, it was shown that the MASEI scores assessed by US were significantly higher in patients with PSS than in healthy controls. Plantar fascia, Achilles tendon, and distal patellar tendon were significantly thicker in the PSS group than in the healthy controls. This result suggests that PSS may be one of the causes of musculoskeletal pain that can be seen in patients with PSS. Our study was the first study to use an enthesis index ultrasonographically in patients with PSS. In addition, it is the first study to investigate the relationship between the presence of enthesopathy and disease activity by means of US.

15903021	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays an important role. There are, however, controversial reports that TNF-alpha promoter polymorphism may be an independent marker of susceptibility and severity of RA. The aim of the present study was to examine the TNF-alpha -308 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA. We examined 91 patients with RA diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used for analysis of the polymorphism at position -308 in promoter of TNF-alpha gene. Distribution of TNF-alpha genotypes in RA patients did not differ from that in control subjects. Moreover, there was no association between TNF-alpha genotypes and age at disease diagnosis, disease activity in global physician\&#39;s assessment, and joint and extra-articular involvement. There was also no correlation between TNF-alpha polymorphism and disease activity measures, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, number of swollen and tender joints, and morning stiffness duration. We suggest that TNF-alpha -308 promoter polymorphism is not a genetic risk factor for RA susceptibility and severity.

12747278	Clinical Trial	Low or medium dose prednisone in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), albeit with significant variation in clinical efficacy, reduces the progression of joint damage. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) might be helpful to predict which patients will respond to low or medium dose prednisone and therefore do not or will not need higher doses. With this in mind we determined in a double blind, placebo controlled study at baseline and yearly the GR number in PBMC. Eighty-one early RA patients (disease duration less than one year) were included. All patients fulfilled the ACR criteria and were disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and glucocorticoid-naive. They were randomly assigned to treatment with 10 mg prednisone daily or placebo. From all patients disease activity (CRP, number of tender and swollen joints), the radiological joint score, bone mineral density, and the GR number in PBMC were measured annually. In females the GR number was up-regulated over time in both the prednisone and the placebo group. The same trend was observed in males. No correlations were found between the GR number in the prednisone users at the start of their treatment and changes in radiological scores or bone density after 2 years of treatment. No correlations were found between the GR number at the start and the clinical characteristics after a follow-up of 2 years. The GR number in the PBMC of early RA patients did not predict which patients would be prednisone responders based on clinical or radiological parameters. However, the up-regulation of the GR number in PBMC in early RA patients towards the GR number of healthy subjects during the first two years of their disease course seems to reflect a recovery or compensatory mechanism as a response to an ongoing inflammatory process. This recovery may be not enough to efficiently control the inflammatory situation.

26767827	Clinical Trial, Phase IV	The pro-inflammatory proteins calprotectin (a heterocomplex of S100A8/A9) and S100A12 have been associated with disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to compare their potential as biomarkers in a prospective study of RA patients starting with infliximab as their first biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Thirty-nine RA patients were examined and serum samples collected when starting with infliximab and after 3, 6, and 12 months. Calprotectin and S100A12 were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and, together with C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), measured at all time points. A disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28) was calculated. Radiographs of the hands, wrists, and feet were taken at baseline and after 3 years, and assessed according to the modified Sharp/van der Heijde (SvH) score. Responsiveness was evaluated according to the European League of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) response criteria based on 28 joints. Both S100 proteins were significantly higher in seropositive than in seronegative patients (p = 0.01). Calprotectin correlated significantly with CRP (ρ = 0.51-0.75), ESR (ρ = 0.32-0.52), and DAS28 (ρ = 0.32-0.62). S100A12 correlated with calprotectin (ρ = 0.62-0.77) and CRP (ρ = 0.32-0.63). The S100 proteins, and especially calprotectin (ρ = 0.23-0.39), showed weak associations with radiographic progression, unlike CRP/ESR. None of the S100 proteins could predict responsiveness. Calprotectin showed the strongest correlation with measures of disease activity and may be better than S100A12 when evaluating disease activity in RA patients. More extensive studies are needed to further compare the predictive value of the S100 proteins relative to radiographic progression.

17849729	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, is a chronic, inflammatory, progressive disease. Most patients have moderate disease, with a variable disease course and symptomatic flares interspersed with periods of relatively lower disease activity. Over the last 2 decades, the treatment of RA has evolved dramatically, from use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs to newer biologics. None of these therapies represents a cure for RA; however, the availability and the efficacy of multiple treatments has made remission of the disease a realistic target.

1361702	English Abstract	For a comprehensive model of rheumatoid arthritis treatment, we designed an arthritis manual for continuous treatment of chronic illness. One goal of introducing the manual to the patients was the improvement of communication between patient and different doctors and therapists. The first part includes of a doctor\&#39;s documentation sheet and a patient calendar (6 months each) for daily self-documentation of drug compliance. The second part is a daily pain-rating scale. The 3-year evaluation of 655 patient manuals for 286 patients was analyzed to estimate the compliance in using the manual. Overall, 87% of diagnoses, 83% of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), 87% of non-steroidal anti-rheumatic drugs (NSAIDs) had been documented in the manual. Data indicates that the general practitioner and the rheumatologist accepted the manual form. In addition, 85% of the documented patients used the DMARDs, 74% used the daily pain score, and 43% the daily physiotherapy. Subgroup data (n = 130 RA patients) suggest additional results: 1) there was no difference in sociodemographic data between the patient manual user group and the non-user group; 2) the user group consisted of patients with higher disease activity (ARA-criteria), higher pain score, and negative mood pattern. Furthermore, the user group was more active in daily physiotherapy, ergotherapy, and balneotherapy.

28965775	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory disease of multiple joints that puts the patient at high risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The aim of the present study was to conduct an up-to-date systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess potential changes in RA disease activity, inflammation, and CVD risk after oral intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Publications up to July 31, 2016 were examined using the PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases. English language; human subjects; both sexes; RCTs; oral intake of ω-3 fatty acids; minimum duration of 3 mo; and no medication change throughout intervention. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess quality of trials. We included 20 RCTs, involving 717 patients with RA in the intervention group and 535 RA patients in the control group. Despite the evidence of overall low quality of trials, consumption of ω-3 fatty acids was found to significantly improve eight disease-activity-related markers. Regarding inflammation, only leukotriene B4 was reduced (five trials, standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.440; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.676 to -0.205; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 46.5%; P &lt; 0.001). A significant amelioration was found for blood triacylglycerol levels (three trials, SMD, -0.316; 95% CI, -0.561 to -0.070; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0%; P = 0.012). The beneficial properties of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on RA disease activity confirm the results of previous meta-analyses. Among five proinflammatory markers evaluated, only leukotriene B4 was found to be reduced. However, a positive effect on blood lipid profile of patients with RA was evident, perhaps for the first time.

9219699	Clinical Trial	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a proinflammatory cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, and antagonism of TNF may reduce the activity of the disease. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of a novel TNF antagonist - a recombinant fusion protein that consists of the soluble TNF receptor (p75) linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (TNFR:Fc). In this multicenter, double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 180 patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis to receive subcutaneous injections of placebo or one of three doses of TNFR:Fc (0.25, 2, or 16 mg per square meter of body-surface area) twice weekly for three months. The clinical response was measured by changes in composite symptoms of arthritis defined according to American College of Rheumatology criteria. Treatment with TNFR:Fc led to significant reductions in disease activity, and the therapeutic effects of TNFR:Fc were dose-related. At three months, 75 percent of the patients in the group assigned to 16 mg of TNFR:Fc per square meter had improvement of 20 percent or more in symptoms, as compared with 14 percent in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001). In the group assigned to 16 mg per square meter, the mean percent reduction in the number of tender or swollen joints at three months was 61 percent, as compared with 25 percent in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001). The most common adverse events were mild injection-site reactions and mild upper respiratory tract symptoms. There were no dose-limiting toxic effects, and no antibodies to TNFR:Fc were detected in serum samples. In this three-month trial TNFR:Fc was safe, well tolerated, and associated with improvement in the inflammatory symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

29299343	Journal Article	To describe the diagnostic spectrum, arthritis persistency and clinical outcomes after 2 years in patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) of less than 16 weeks\&#39; duration. Data from the Norwegian Very Early Arthritis Clinic, a 2-year longitudinal observational study of adults with IA of ≤16 weeks\&#39; duration, were used. Exclusion criteria were arthritis due to crystal deposits, trauma, osteoarthritis and septic arthritis. In all patients who had any follow-up information (population A), clinical diagnoses and persistency of arthritis were described. For patients with 2-year follow-up (population B), we also studied other clinical outcomes (disease activity, pain, fatigue, functional disability and health-related quality of life). In population A (n=1017) median (25th-75th percentile) duration of joint swelling was 35.0 (13.0-66.5) days, mean (SD) age 45.7 (14.8) years, 55.2% were females and 17.8% anticitrullinated protein antibodies positive. The most common final diagnoses were undifferentiated arthritis (UA) (41.7%), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (24.1%) and reactive arthritis (18.1%). After 2 years, the arthritis had resolved in 59% of the patients. The remaining 41.0% had persistent disease defined by disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) use (32.1%) or persistent joint swelling without DMARD use (8.9%). In population B (n=669), all clinical outcomes improved significantly (P&lt;0.001). Baseline joint pain and fatigue were similar across diagnoses. Among 1017 patients with IA of ≤16 weeks\&#39; duration, UA was the most common diagnosis after 2 years, and less than one-fourth were diagnosed with RA. Arthritis resolved without DMARDs in the majority of the patients. All clinical parameters improved significantly over a 2-year course.

29079928	Journal Article	Accelerated coronary atherosclerosis is common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To examine coronary artery calcification (CAC) frequency and severity, its correlation with traditional risk factors (TRF) of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and inflammatory markers in patients with early RA prior to anti-rheumatic therapy. RA adult patients (ACR/EULAR criteria, 2010, duration ≤ 12 months, without prior administration of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, glucocorticoids) underwent 32-row scanning for CAC scoring. Agatston, volume and mass calcium scores were calculated. Additionally, we used calculators on the website of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. 74 RA patients (women n = 54 (73%), median age 56 years, median RA duration 6 months) with moderate/high RA activity (median DAS28 [ESR] 5.4) were enrolled within the framework of the observational study. Most of the patients had multiple TRFs of CVD and subclinical organ damage. CAC has been detected in 34 (46%) early RA patients. Calcification severity was significantly higher in men and in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). In patients younger than 45 years (n = 16) CAC was not detected. Among patients older than 45 years (n = 58), the frequency of CAC was 59%: asymptomatic patients-n = 46 (48%), IHD patients-n = 12 (100%). Among asymptomatic patients the presence of CAC associated with a significantly higher frequency of arterial hypertension (1.6 fold) compared with cases without CAC. Coronary age in asymptomatic patients with CAC and IHD patients was significantly greater than their actual age. More than half of early RA patients older 45 years had CAC. The presence and severity of CAC correlated positively with TRFs, but not with lipid levels and RA activity.

24284270	Clinical Trial	Measurement of the femoral cartilage thickness by using in-vivo musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSUS) has been previously shown to be a valid and reliable method in previous studies; however, to our best notice, normative data has not been provided before in the healthy population.The aim of our study was to provide normative data regarding femoral cartilage thicknesses of healthy individuals with collaborative use of MSUS. This is across-sectional study run at Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine Departments of 18 Secondary and Tertiary Centers in Turkey. 1544 healthy volunteers (aged between 25-40 years) were recruited within the collaboration of TURK-MUSCULUS (Turkish Musculoskeletal Ultrasonography Study Group). Subjects who had a body mass index value of less than 30 and who did not have signs and symptoms of any degenerative/inflammatory arthritis or other rheumatic diseases, history of knee trauma and previous knee surgery were enrolled. Ultrasonographic measurements were performed axially from the suprapatellar window by using linear probes while subjects\&#39; knees were in maximum flexion. Three (mid-point) measurements were taken from both knees (lateral condyle, intercondylar area, medial condyle). A total of 2876 knees (of 817 M, 621 F subjects) were taken into analysis after exclusion of inappropriate images. Mean cartilage thicknesses were significantly lower in females than males (all p&lt; 0.001). Thickness values negatively correlated with age; negatively (females) and positively (males) correlated with smoking. Men who regularly exercised had thicker cartilage than who did not exercise (all p &lt; 0.05). Increased age (in both sexes) and absence of exercise (males) were found to be risk factors for decreased cartilage thicknesses. Further data pertaining to other countries would be interesting to uncover whether ethnic differences also affect cartilage thickness. Collaborative use of MSUS seems to be promising in this regard.

28243799	Journal Article	Since the previous studies showed that anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) can induce osteoclasts differentiation and activation, even before arthritis onset, the aim of our study was to determine whether ACPA-positivity is associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) at baseline visit of a register of early arthritis (EA) patients. The study population comprised 578 patients (80% females) from our EA clinic with a median disease duration, 5.1 months (p25-p75: 6-8); median age, 53.6 years (41.9-66.1), 38% ACPA-positive, and 55% fulfilling 2010 criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry at lumbar spine, hip, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints of the non-dominant hand to evaluate both systemic and juxta-articular bone mass. ACPA titers were determined through enzyme immunoassay. The effect of ACPA on BMD was analyzed using multivariable analysis based on generalized linear models adjusted for various confounders. ACPA-positive patients showed lower bone mass at lumbar spine and hip, but no differences were observed at MCP joints compared to ACPA-negative patients. However, ACPA-positive patients displayed higher disease activity and disability than ACPA-negative patients. After adjustment for gender, age, body mass index, and other bone-related variables, the presence of ACPA remained significantly associated with lower BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip but not at MCP joints. Disease activity was not associated with baseline bone mass. Our data reinforce the previous preclinical findings suggesting that the systemic bone loss detected at the initial phases of early ACPA-positive arthritis is independent of inflammatory status and, therefore, could be mediated by ACPA.

6442711	Clinical Trial	Auranofin, an orally active gold preparation, was compared with sodium aurothiomalate in a double-blind trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis fulfilling the ARA criteria, who had been stabilized on sodium aurothiomalate for at least six months. Twenty-four patients have so far been entered in the trial, of whom fourteen have been randomly allocated to receive auranofin and ten to receive sodium aurothiomalate. After initial stabilization, patients receive either auranofin 6 mg daily and placebo injection, or sodium aurothiomalate 50 mg monthly and placebo tablets. Five patients have completed one year on auranofin. The remaining nine patients were withdrawn because of loss of efficacy (two), side-effects, (five), loss of efficacy and side-effects (one) and default (one). Four patients have completed one year\&#39;s treatment with sodium aurothiomalate. Of the remaining six patients, two were withdrawn because of side-effects, three because of poor disease control and one because of side-effects and poor disease control. Diarrhoea occurred in eight patients receiving auranofin. Rashes occurred in both groups but otherwise there were no serious side-effects. The efficacy of both drugs appeared similar, there being no significant differences in morning stiffness, fatiguability, visual analogue pain score, grip strength and articular index. There were also no significant differences in laboratory parameters of efficacy. Auranofin appears to control disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis but diarrhoea is a frequent side-effect.

20617358	Journal Article	As tocilizumab (TCZ) greatly inhibits inflammatory markers, methods of evaluating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity that include inflammatory markers may overestimate the effect of TCZ treatment. We have evaluated the impact of inflammatory markers on the efficacy of TCZ by comparing the efficacy indicated by the 28-joint disease activity score using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) with that indicated by the clinical and simplified disease activity indexes (CDAI and SDAI, respectively) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) core set criteria in a double-blind study of TCZ-the SATORI study. The Spearman correlation coefficient between DAS28-ESR and CDAI was comparable between that at week 24 and that at baseline [correlation coefficient at baseline and week 24 was 0.823 (p &lt; 0.0001) and 0.818 (p &lt; 0.0001), respectively]. A large difference between the DAS28 remission rate and CDAI remission rate was observed at week 24. However, these results are comparable to those of a previous study conducted with non-TCZ-treated patients. Moreover, the same results were obtained in the comparison between the DAS28-ESR and SDAI, even though the SDAI includes an inflammatory parameter as a component. These results confirm that the DAS28-ESR has a validity comparable to that of other methods in terms of evaluating the RA treatment efficacy of TCZ, despite its strong inflammatory marker-inhibiting effects.

27239922	English Abstract	To determine N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); to compare NT-proBNP values with traditional risk factors (TRF), cardiovascular diseases (CVD), inflammatory markers, and left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (DD). The investigation enrolled 74 patients with a valid RA diagnosis (the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria), 56 (74%) women, median (Me) age, 54 years; disease duration, 7 months; seropositive for IgM rheumatoid factor (87%) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (100%) with no history of the use of DMARDs and glucocorticosteroids. Duplex scanning and echographic findings were used to assess TRF for CVD and carotid artery atherosclerosis (CAA) in all the patients with early RA prior to therapy. An E/A ratio was used as a criterion for LVDD. NT-proBNP concentrations in patients with early RA proved to be higher than those in the control group (p&lt;0.0001). Higher-than-normal NT-proBNP levels were seen in 36 (49%) patients. The patients with early RA and elevated NT-proBNP values were older and had a higher body mass index (BMI) than those with normal NT-proBNP levels. Those with elevated NT-proBNP concentrations were more frequently found to have CAA, coronary calcification, and coronary heart disease; their intima-media thickness was also larger and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels higher than in those with normal NT-proBNP values. There were correlations between NT-proBNP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, simplified disease activity index, and clinical disease activity index. Multivariate analysis revealed that chronic heart failure (CHF), CAA, CRP and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and BMI correlated with NT-proBNP concentrations. LVDD was detected in 35 (48%) patients with early RA. The level of NT-proBNP in patients with DD was higher than in those without DD. Higher-than-normal NT-proBNP values were observed in 23 (65%) and 12 (32%) patients with and without LVDD, respectively. The optimal NT-proBNP level for CHF detection was equal to 237.4 pg/ml (86% sensitivity and 85% specificity); the area under the ROC curve was 0.879. Just at the early disease stage, the patients are noted to have a high NT-proBNP level that is influenced by higher BMI, low LDL levels, CAA, CHF, and high CRP values. In the patients with early RA, the diagnostically significant NT-proBNP concentration for CHF detection was higher (237 pg/ml) than in those without RA (125 pg/ml). The patients with early RA should undergo NT-proBNP determination, LVDD screening, correction of TRF for CVD, atherosclerosis treatment, and remission achievement.

25303739	Journal Article	Studies suggest that hormonal states affect disease characteristics in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study investigated how age at menopause affects disease in women presenting with early RA. This was a cross-sectional study of postmenopausal women with early RA under age 65 years at time of enrollment in the Canadian Early Arthritis Cohort. RA-related disease characteristics in women who had early age at menopause (EM; age at menopause &lt;45 years) were compared to those who had usual age at menopause (age at menopause ≥45 years). The t-test was applied to continuous variables and the chi-square test to categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for age at menopause, smoking, and use of exogenous hormones. A total of 534 women were included; 93 were in the EM group. The age at RA onset was similar between groups. The EM group had higher mean patient global and pain scores and was more likely to be rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and meet the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. Using multivariate logistic regression, the EM group was more likely to be RF positive (odds ratio 2.2 [95% confidence interval 1.3-3.8], P = 0.005). Symptom duration, joint counts, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, Health Assessment Questionnaire scores, and inflammatory markers did not differ between groups. These data suggest that early age at menopause, compared to usual age at menopause, is associated with seropositivity in women with early RA.

7983640	Comparative Study	We have assessed the importance of the distinction between classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that recognize the presence of currently active disease from those that, in addition, incorporate evidence of past disease activity in ascertaining disease occurrence. We applied 7 classification schemes to a population of twins with inflammatory arthritis to determine (a) the number of individuals classified as RA positive by each scheme and hence the effect on the estimate of disease concordance in the twins and (b) their performance in correctly assigning a diagnosis compared with a physician\&#39;s opinion. The schemes assessed were the 1958 ARA (Rome) criteria which detect active disease, the 1966 New York (using both the 2/4 and 3/4 published cutoffs) which detect \&quot;ever\&quot; disease and 4 variants of the 1987 ARA criteria. These were the 4/7 and decision tree approaches applied on the basis of the relevant features (1) being present at the time of the study and (2) being present ever and allowing current joint deformity to substitute for absent joint swelling. In all, 283 individuals with a history of joint swelling were assessed, 255 of whom were considered to have RA by their physician. Criteria used to recognize \&quot;current\&quot; RA identified only about 70% of those which recognized RA ever. These differences in ascertainment level produced a marked effect on the monozygotic twin RA concordance estimates with percentages ranging from 10 to 18%. The results from receiver operating curves confirmed that criteria used to assess only current RA were too insensitive to be of value. Of the criteria that recognized RA status ever the 1987 ARA performed best overall. The use of classification methods that incorporate past as well as current evidence of disease activity is essential to avoid important misclassification in epidemiological and family studies. The 1987 criteria, applied retrospectively and allowing joint deformity to substitute for swelling, are of enhanced value over other existing schemes.

19443940	Journal Article	Leflunomide is an isoxazole derivative that is structurally and functionally unrelated to other known immunomodulatory drugs. Previous studies have revealed that therapy with leflunomide causes decreased production of mediators such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, which are involved in inflammatory process. The aim of the present study was to examine whether the polymorphisms in genes IL1B, IL6, and TNF may affect treatment outcomes in RA patients treated with leflunomide. The study was carried out on 129 patients (106 women, 23 men, mean age 52.9 +/- 11.03) diagnosed with RA and treated with leflunomide 20 mg daily. Clinical improvement was evaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20% and 50% response criteria. There were no statistically significant associations between the studied genotypes and improvement of disease activity parameters. The results of the present study suggest that IL1beta, IL6, and TNF gene polymorphisms are not significant factors influencing the therapy outcome of RA patients with leflunomide.

19650566	English Abstract	Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory chronic disease that affects 0.5-1% of the population, many of whom develop disease as working-age adults. The aim of examination was to estimate functional disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and relationship between radiological damage, disease duration, disease activity, functional disability. The examination involved 60 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, aged (53.92 +/- 7.06) of both genders (48 female, 12 male). The following variables were assessed at one time point: swollen and tender joint count, visual analogue scale for pain, erythrocite sedimentation rate, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) score, anatomical stage and functional class according to Stenbrocker\&#39;s criteria. Disease activity was expressed as 28 joint disease activity score (DAS28). Correlations were calculated by Spearman\&#39;s coefficient of correlation. In our study 82% of the patients had II and III anatomical stage and 80% of the patients had II and III functional class according to Steinbrocker\&#39;s criteria. The median HAQ score was 1.25 +/- 0.70, and the median DAS28 was 5.74 +/- 0.98. Poor functional status was observed in 37 (61.66%) of the patients with an HAQ score of = 2. Functional disability in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was most strongly related to the presence of pain (rs=0.338, p&lt;0.01) and to a lesser extent to anatomical and functional stage, disease duration, disease activity. The results of the study show that functional disability significantly correlated with subjective pain score (rs=0.338, p&lt;0.01). We observed strong correlation between functional disability presented by HAQ score and pain but no significant correlation with other common clinical variables used for rheumatoid arthritis patients evaluation such as disease duration, disease activity, radiological damage.

We aimed to study clinical and electrophysiological neuropathy and pathological changes in sural nerve in patients with RA. One hundred eight patients of RA, fulfilling American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria (mean age, 45.83 years; M/F 1:3, 80.3% seropositive) were examined clinically and electrophysiologically for evidence of peripheral neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsies were performed in the involved cases. In all RA patient medications, disease activity, results of blood tests, and X-rays of affected joints were recorded. Twenty-three patients complained of paresthesias in the extremities. Vibration sensations were decreased in 9, and tendon reflexes were decreased or absent in 28 patients. Sixty-two (57.4%) patients had electrophysiologic evidence of neuropathy. Of these 53 (85.5%) patients had pure sensory or sensory motor axonal neuropathy (mononeuritis multiplex, n = 7), while 9 (14.5%) had demyelinating neuropathy (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, n = 1). Carpal tunnel syndrome was seen in 11 (10.1%) patients (associated with neuropathy in 6). Of 23 sural nerve biopsies available, perineurial thickening (n = 5, amyloid deposits n = 4), perivascular lymphomononuclear cell infiltrate (n = 4), loss of myelin fibers (n = 2), and necrotizing vasculitis (n = 1) were found. Clinically, however, seven patients had evidence of cutaneous vasculitis. Comparing the clinical characteristics of the patients with or without electrophysiological neuropathy, absence of deep tendon jerks (p &lt; 0.005) and presence of extra articular manifestations (p &lt; 0.01) were conspicuous in the neuropathic group. There was no relation of neuropathy with the duration of RA, seropositivity, joint erosions, joint deformities, prior disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or glucocorticoid intake, and 28-joint disease activity score. Neuropathy in RA was mostly subclinical and predominantly axonal. Pathologically, neuropathy secondary to amyloid infiltration was second only to vasculitic neuropathy. Absence of deep tendon jerks and presence of vasculitis were more commonly observed in patients with neuropathy.

16705046	Journal Article	Anti-tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) therapies represent an important advancement in therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, there remains a proportion of patients who do not improve despite therapy. These drugs are expensive and have the potential of serious toxicity. Therefore, it would be ideal to predict the patients who will respond, so that the use of these drugs can be targetted. To identify the clinical factors present at the start of anti-TNF-alpha therapy that are associated with response at 6 months in patients with RA. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) Biologics Register collects detailed data on all patients with a rheumatic disease receiving biologic therapy in the UK. We studied all patients with RA who had started etanercept (ETA) or infliximab (INF) and had achieved a minimum 6 months follow-up by 1 October, 2004. The disease status at the baseline and at 6 months was assessed using the Disease Activity Score (DAS28). The response was classified according to the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) improvement criteria. The effect of baseline characteristics on response was studied using multivariate ordinal logistic regression. 2879 patients were included in this analysis (1267 ETA, 1612 INF). At the start of therapy, the mean age was 55 yrs, disease duration 14 yrs, baseline DAS28 6.7 and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) 2.1. In all, 28% of ETA and 86% of INF patients were receiving methotrexate. After 6 months, 18% had a good EULAR response, of whom 9% were considered to be in remission and 50% had a moderate response. There was no overall difference in response rate between the two anti-TNF-alpha therapies. A higher baseline HAQ score correlated with a lower response rate while a better response was associated with the current use of NSAIDs and the use of methotrexate (MTX), although the latter only reached statistical significance with ETA [OR 1.82 (95% CI 1.38-2.40)]. There was a lower response rate among current smokers, particularly in patients receiving INF [OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.60-0.99)]. Age, disease duration, rheumatoid factor and the previous number of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) did not predict response to either drug. However, females were less likely to achieve remission. These data support an improved outcome among patients receiving MTX in combination with anti-TNF-alpha therapies. However, the most disabled patients were less likely to respond, despite concurrent MTX. The benefits of NSAIDs may reflect the relative absence of comorbidities in patients who can tolerate these drugs or the continuing presence of reversible inflammatory symptoms. The association of smoking and poor outcome with INF is a novel finding and may reflect alterations in pharmacokinetics. The inability of other baseline disease characteristics to predict the outcome suggests that other factors, including potential genetic differences in drug metabolism, may be influencing the response to anti-TNF-alpha therapies.

29417936	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints and is associated with autoantibodies that target various molecules including modified self-epitopes. The identification of novel autoantibodies has improved diagnostic accuracy, and newly developed classification criteria facilitate the recognition and study of the disease early in its course. New clinical assessment tools are able to better characterize disease activity states, which are correlated with progression of damage and disability, and permit improved follow-up. In addition, better understanding of the pathogenesis of RA through recognition of key cells and cytokines has led to the development of targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Altogether, the improved understanding of the pathogenetic processes involved, rational use of established drugs and development of new drugs and reliable assessment tools have drastically altered the lives of individuals with RA over the past 2 decades. Current strategies strive for early referral, early diagnosis and early start of effective therapy aimed at remission or, at the least, low disease activity, with rapid adaptation of treatment if this target is not reached. This treat-to-target approach prevents progression of joint damage and optimizes physical functioning, work and social participation. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of RA.	NA	Nature reviews.

21448555	Journal Article	To determine the validity of 15 standardized instruments frequently used to measure the outcome of chronic arthritis treatment. Analyses were performed on data collected at a rehabilitation programme (n=216). The outcome measures evaluated were health-related quality of life, global health, pain, physical function and aerobic capacity. The instrument items were linked to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (content validity), construct validity was analysed based on predetermined hypothesis (Spearman\&#39;s correlations, rs), and responsiveness (after 18 days and 12 months) by the standardized response mean. Most instruments covered the ICF component body function and/or activity-participation, only a few covered the environmental component. The short Euroqol-5 Dimensions performed as well as the longer health-related quality of life instruments in covering the ICF and in responsiveness. The health-related quality of life instruments did not measure similar constructs as hypothesized, neither did pain measures. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis indices covered several components of the ICF often exhibiting a large responsiveness. Aerobic capacity had the largest responsiveness of all measures. Many instruments are not highly correlated, although at face value they appear to measure the same construct, information also applying to content validity and responsiveness. Results from this study can assist in choosing outcome measures in the clinic and in research.

25600850	Journal Article	Pain remains the most important problem for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Active inflammatory disease contributes to pain, but pain due to non-inflammatory mechanisms can confound the assessment of disease activity. We hypothesize that augmented pain processing, fibromyalgic features, poorer mental health, and patient-reported 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) components are associated in RA. In total, 50 people with stable, long-standing RA recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic were assessed for pain-pressure thresholds (PPTs) at three separate sites (knee, tibia, and sternum), DAS28, fibromyalgia, and mental health status. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the association between PPT and DAS28 components, DAS28-P (the proportion of DAS28 derived from the patient-reported components of visual analogue score and tender joint count), or fibromyalgia status. More-sensitive PPTs at sites over or distant from joints were each associated with greater reported pain, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. A high proportion of participants (48%) satisfied classification criteria for fibromyalgia, and fibromyalgia classification or characteristics were each associated with more sensitive PPTs, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health. Widespread sensitivity to pressure-induced pain, a high prevalence of fibromyalgic features, higher patient-reported DAS28 components, and poorer mental health are all linked in established RA. The increased sensitivity at nonjoint sites (sternum and anterior tibia), as well as over joints, indicates that central mechanisms may contribute to pain sensitivity in RA. The contribution of patient-reported components to high DAS28 should inform decisions on disease-modifying or pain-management approaches in the treatment of RA when inflammation may be well controlled.

21806812	Journal Article	To evaluate the impact of spinsterhood on disease characteristics and quality of life (QoL) in Moroccan women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 185 women with RA were recruited in this study. Marital status was specified as follow: 1. Spinsterhood (never-married woman aged 38 or over), 2. Distressed marriage; 3. Nondistressed marriage and 4. Divorced or widowed. Marital distress was assessed by a self-report concerning coping efficacy and burden caring of husbands. Assessment criteria included the evaluation of: age at onset (years), diagnosis delay (months), disease duration (years), disease activity (evaluated by physical examination, biological inflammatory tests; and disease activity score (DAS 28)), pain intensity (measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS)); and radiographic damage (evaluated by the Sharp\&#39;s method as modified by van der Heijde). Treatments (doses and duration) were specified. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) was used to evaluate functional disability. QoL was measured using the Arabic version of the generic instrument SF-36. In our data, spinsterhood was detected in 42 (22.7%) patients vs. 88 (47.5%) with distressed marriage, 28 (15.1%) with nondistressed marriage and 27 (14.6%) divorced or widowed. Comparing the 4 groups, we found that QoL in never-married women was damaged in a significant way comparing to the other groups. Mental as well as physical aspects were affected. Also, we found that spinsterhood was associated to an early age at onset (p = 0.009), pain intensity (p &lt; 0.001); clinical (p &lt; 0.001) and biological disease activity (C-reactive protein; p = 0.02) and functional disability (p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between spinsterhood and early age at onset and severe functional disability (for all p ≤ 0.01). This study suggests that spinsterhood in our RA patients was associated with an altered QoL even compared with distressed married women. Also, we state that spinsterhood was associated with an early age at onset, severe joint pain; higher disease activity and with altered functional ability. It seems important to consider not only disease-related parameters but also social status as a determinant factor of poor course in RA.

20662070	Clinical Trial, Phase II	To investigate both the preclinical effects of blocking the chemokine receptor CCR5 and the clinical effects of this approach on the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with active disease. Preclinical evaluations of AZD5672, a small-molecule antagonist of CCR5, were performed, including studies of ligand binding and chemotaxis. The pharmacokinetics of AZD5672 were assessed in both single- and multiple-dose studies in healthy volunteers. A randomized, placebo-controlled, phase IIb study was conducted in patients with active RA receiving methotrexate. Treatment arms were AZD5672 (20, 50, 100, or 150 mg orally, once daily), matched placebo, or open-label etanercept (50 mg subcutaneously, once weekly). The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a 20% improvement response on the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20) at week 12. Secondary end points included the ACR20 over time, as well as 50% (ACR50) and 70% (ACR70) improvement responses, changes in individual components of the ACR improvement criteria, and disease activity measured with the Disease Activity Score based on the 28-joint count. AZD5672 was a highly potent and selective antagonist of CCR5, displaying nonproportional steady-state pharmacokinetics while inhibiting internalization of CCR5 in an ex vivo macrophage inflammatory protein 1β stimulation assay in which AZD5672 was evaluated over the 20-150-mg dose range. In the phase IIb study testing this dose range in patients with RA (n = 371 patients randomized to received treatment), AZD5672 was generally well tolerated, with no unexpected adverse events. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving an ACR20 response at week 12 between those receiving any dose of AZD5672 and those receiving placebo; etanercept was significantly more efficacious than AZD5672 and placebo. Despite a clear rationale for targeting CCR5, this clinical study showed that AZD5672, administered orally, did not have any clinical benefit, suggesting that CCR5 antagonism alone is unlikely to be a viable therapeutic strategy in RA.

15696575	Consensus Development Conference	To establish an expert consensus of best practice for rheumatologists performing musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MUS). A panel of worldwide experts in MUS was identified by literature review, membership of teaching faculty, and peer recommendation. They were invited to take part in a 4-stage Delphi process employing 2 iterative rounds to establish a consensus of specific indications, anatomic areas, and knowledge and skills required by rheumatologists performing MUS. Experts in MUS were identified (n = 57; 37 radiologists, 20 rheumatologists). Successive rounds of this rigorous Delphi exercise enabled group consensus to be achieved in 30 of the proposed 37 categories comprising 8 of 13 indications (inflammatory arthritis, tendon pathology, effusion, bursitis, monitoring disease activity, monitoring disease progression, guided aspiration, and injection), 8 of 10 anatomic areas (hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, hip, knee, ankle and heel, and forefoot), and 14 categories of knowledge and skills (physics, anatomy, pathology, equipment, clinical application and relevance, indications and limitations, artifact, machine function and operation, patient and probe position, planes and system of examination, image optimization, dynamic assessment, color Doppler, and power Doppler). We have produced the first expert-derived, interdisciplinary consensus of recommendations for rheumatologists performing MUS. This represents a significant advance that will not only direct future rheumatology MUS practice, but will facilitate informed educational development. This is an important step towards the introduction of a specific training curriculum and assessment process to ensure competent rheumatologist ultrasonographers.

20219784	Journal Article	To examine the relationship between ultrasound (US)-detected synovial pathology in hand OA and the clinical response to parenteral corticosteroids. People with symptomatic OA of the hand completed questionnaires [visual analogue scale (VAS) pain, Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index and VAS global] and underwent an US examination of both hands prior to receiving an i.m. dose of methylprednisolone. Four- and twelve-week assessments were performed to assess therapeutic response. Thirty-six subjects with established OA were enrolled. Twenty-four (67%) subjects met the primary end-point of a 20% reduction in VAS pain, 25 (69.4%) met the Osteoarthritis Research Society International response criteria at 4 weeks. Overall in the group, there was a reduction in levels of pain in the most painful joint, pain in all joints and in global disease activity at 4 weeks (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). Reduction in symptoms was not associated with a statistically significant reduction in US-detected synovial hypertrophy or power Doppler signal. In this observational study, parenteral corticosteroids were associated with a statistically significant reduction in symptoms, but no statistically significant reduction in US-detected synovial inflammation. The latter finding may, however, reflect the relatively low levels of synovial inflammation detected ultrasonagraphically in hand joints.

24173693	Journal Article	Yoga is a popular activity which may be well suited to some individuals with specific rheumatic disorders. Regular yoga practice can increase muscle strength and endurance, proprioception, and balance, with emphasis on movement through a full range of motion to increase flexibility and mobility. Additional beneficial elements of yoga include breathing, relaxation, body awareness, and meditation, which can reduce stress and anxiety and promote a sense of calmness, general well-being, and improved quality of life. Yoga also encourages a meditative focus, increased body awareness and mindfulness; some evidence suggests yoga may help reduce inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Yoga is best learned under the supervision of qualified teachers who are well informed about the potential musculoskeletal needs of each individual. Here, we briefly review the literature on yoga for healthy, musculoskeletal, and rheumatic disease populations and offer recommendations for discussing ways to begin yoga with patients.

26010598	Journal Article	To describe Filipino patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) entered in the Rheumatoid arthritis database and registry (RADAR) of the Philippine General Hospital. Cases entered to RADAR from 2010-2012 were included. All fulfilled the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for classification of RA. Included cases gave written infomed consent. Data extracted were demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory tests, treatment and disease course. Means and proportions were used for population characteristics. Two hundred and sixty-six cases were included. Mean age was 44 years, with 9 : 1 female preponderance and mean diagnosis time of 5 years. There was symmetrical polyarthritis with high tender and swollen joint count and mean Disease Activity Score of 28 joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 5.27 (3.39, 8.13). Rheumatoid factor was positive in 2/3 of cases. Hypertension, tuberculosis and diabetes were important co-morbidities. Treatment included prednisone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and methotrexate. At 12 months of treatment, evaluable cases (&lt; 20%) showed improvement from high to moderate disease activity. Methotrexate average dose was 8.6 mg/week. Nine cases received biologic agents. Factors affecting treatment included access to rheumatology centers, low socioeconomic status, presence of co-morbid diseases and treatment adverse events. This study reports a cohort of Filipino RA patients seen in a government arthritis unit whose disease characteristics are similar to what is reported worldwide. This cohort differs from most studies in having a high female to male ratio, a long delay in diagnosis, and high attrition rate. Mean methotrexate dose was low and there was less access to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.

13679660	Journal Article	Thromboangiitis obliterans is defined as an inflammatory disease involving small and medium sized arteries and veins. As no clinical symptoms, signs, radiological or laboratory abnormalities nor pathological features are specific, the diagnosis is usually made according the criteria proposed by Adar in a young smoker, male or female, with distal arterial occlusions sometimes associated with thrombophlebitis and with negative aetiological investigations. Recently, rheumatic manifestations were identified in about 10% of patients. If new developments in vascular medicine, as ultrasound explorations or CT scan limit the indications for angiography, others, especially in the field of thrombophilia, make more difficult the differential diagnosis. If the strong link between the disease activity and smoking habits is confirmed, medical or surgical approach remain disappointing. Takayasu\&#39;s disease or non specific aorto-arteritis is an inflammatory disease of young women that primarily affects the aorta its main branches and the pulmonary arteries. The disease often start in children. The prevalence of the disease as the arterial lesions show geographical variations. That and the different associations with infectious, rheumatic or systemic diseases could justify to consider Takayasu\&#39;s disease as a syndrome. B-mode ultrasonography and electron beam computed tomography are usually sufficient to characterize the arterial involvement and are essential for the follow up of patients. In some rare cases arterial biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The surgical treatment concerns specific lesions with ischemic symptoms and failure of the medical approach, however endovascular techniques are often discussed in first intention. During inflammatory phases with evolutive lesions corticosteroids are often used. In case of failure cyclophosphamide or methotrexate have been used.

20084988	Journal Article	To determine the socio-demographic profiles and some clinical aspects of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prospective, cross-sectional study. Ambulatory out- patient clinics of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), a public national and referral hospital. Out of 180 patients interviewed and examined, 60 met American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria of RA. Of the 60 patients recruited 52 (87%) were females with male: female ratio of 1: 6.5. The mean age of patients was 41.38(+/- 16.8) years. There were two peaks of age of occurrence, 20-29 and 40-49 years. In 75% of the study patients, one or more of metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand were involved in the disease. Other frequently involved sites were--wrists, elbows, knees, ankles and glenohumeral joints of shoulders in a symmetrical manner. Serum rheumatoid factor was positive in 78.9% while rheumatoid nodules were present in 13.3% of the study patients. A large majority of patients (88%) had active disease with 18% having mild disease, 38% moderate activity and 32% having severe disease. Only 12% of patients had disease in remission. Forty six point seven per cent (46.7%) of the study patients were on at least one Disease Modifying anti Rheumatic Drugs (DMARD) from a selection of methotrexate, sulphasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and leflunamide. The most frequent drug combination was methotrexate plus prednisolone at 30% of the study population; while 66.7% were on oral prednisolone with 25% of the study patients taking only Non-Steroidal anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS). A large majority of ambulatory patients with RA had active disease. Most of them were sub-optimally treated, especially the use of DMARDS. About two thirds were on oral steroids. Sub-optimal therapy in relatively young patients, peak 20-29 and 40-49 years is likely to impact negatively on their disease control and quality of life.

28035438	Journal Article	A spectrum of disease extends beyond the rigid confines of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) encompasses non-radiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA) in individuals without established radiographic changes but with other clinical/imaging axSpA features and AS in those with definite sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic X-rays. A broad consensus about the management of nr-axSpA is emerging among clinicians, but the evidence base remains open to question. To explore whether nr-axSpA and AS should be treated similarly, we examined the literature on their prevalence, natural history, disease burden, and treatment. There is strong evidence that nr-axSpA and AS are expressions of the same disease. Approximately 10% of patients with nr-axSpA will develop radiographic disease over 2 years; after &gt;20 years, the figure may exceed 80%. Nr-axSpA patients have lower CRP and less spinal inflammation on MRI than AS patients but similar disease activity, pain, and quality-of-life impairment. Most patients with nr-axSpA manage well with conservative treatment, but a minority has severe disabling symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy has demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in nr-axSpA and AS. Current evidence does not clearly indicate that anti-TNF treatment can inhibit or limit bony progression of AS, the basis of conservative and anti-TNF treatment is control of symptoms and function. For some patients with nr-axSpA, the need for powerful treatments is as great as in some with AS; thus, treatment of axSpA should be consistent across the axSpA spectrum with anti-TNF agents being available, irrespective of radiographic change, according to the same criteria as those applied to AS.

26261379	Journal Article	We aimed to describe the distribution of the main risk factors among primary health care users diagnosed with osteoarthritis in Albania, a post-communist country in South Eastern Europe. Our study involved all individuals who were diagnosed with osteoarthritis over a two-year period (January 2013 - December 2014) in several primary health care centers in Tirana, the Albanian capital. On the whole, during this two-year period, 1179 adult individuals were diagnosed with osteoarthritis (521 men aged 60.1±10.6 years and 658 women aged 58.1±9.6 years). According to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, the diagnosis of osteoarthritis was based on the history of the disease, physical examination, laboratory findings and radiological findings. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the sex-differences regarding the major risk factors among individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, female gender was inversely associated with smoking (OR=0.39, 95%CI=0.27-0.56), alcohol intake (OR=0.08, 95%CI=0.06-0.10), overweight but not obesity (OR=0.65, 95%CI=0.46-0.91 and OR=0.74, 95%CI=0.46-1.18, respectively), weight lifting (OR=0.38, 95%CI=0.22-0.66) and heavy physical exercise (OR=0.69, 95%CI=0.46-1.03). Conversely, female gender was positively related to genetic factors (OR=2.17, 95%CI=1.55-3.04) and preexisting inflammatory diseases (OR=1.53, 95%CI=0.93-2.53). This study offers useful evidence about the distribution of the main risk factors for osteoarthritis in adult individuals diagnosed with osteoarthritis in Albania. This information may support health professionals and decision-makers in Albania for evidence-based health planning and policy formulation in order to control the toll of osteoarthritis in this transitional society.

15471599	Comparative Study	DNA chip is a recently developed technique allowing analysis of thousands of genes at the same time in multiple biological samples. In few years it has become an obligatory step in massive gene expression study. The enormous quantity of results generated and the new way of thinking allowed make this kind of study a true revolution. The enormous discovery potential permitted by the accomplishment of multiple genomes sequencing and the advent of technologies allowing massive gene expression analyses have totally modified the diseases approach. Considering the obtainment of a real full picture of the transcriptional activity in an organ, tissue or cell is now legitimate. DNA microarray is obviously not the only technique allowing such type of analysis but it is without contest the technology which is the most popular and the one which has been recently the subject of the most important developments. It is certainly the technology which brought the main advances in tumour classification and discovery of new biomarkers. The first results based on this technology in inflammatory diseases have recently been reported. The optimal use of DNA microarrays will necessitate a powerful statistical analysis and an high quality biological experimentation. Strict standard and quality criteria are developing. Obviously, the DNA chips have a role to play in multifactorial inflammatory diseases mainly through their potential to bring new answers to diagnostic and pathophysiological problems. One potential development of the technique in such diseases will be the definition of disease specific gene profiles and the generation of chips allowing the detection of few targeted genes with all the known mutations of these genes. The correlation of global or targeted gene expression with clinical and pathological data will allow a new step forward in the understanding and taking care of inflammatory diseases.

22032341	Journal Article	Vaspin and omentin are two recently discovered adipokines that have been involved in chronic inflammatory processes. The aims of our study were to evaluate their serum levels in patients affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in comparison to healthy controls, and to correlate circulating levels to parameters of disease activity. Serum levels of omentin and vaspin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 40 patients with JIA classified according to the ILAR criteria and 26 healthy controls. Serum omentin levels were significantly higher in JIA patients versus healthy controls (p&lt;0.0001) whereas serum vaspin levels did not significantly differ between the two groups. JIA children with active joints showed higher omentin serum levels than JIA children without active joints (p&lt;0.001) and omentin serum levels significantly correlated with the presence of active joints (p&lt;0.0001). Omentin serum levels were also significantly related with the number of active joints (p&lt;0.002). Vaspin serum level did not show statistical significant differences between JIA children with active joints and those with no active joints. There was no correlation between plasma vaspin levels and the presence of active joints, or the number of active joints Our study is the first report on the new adipokines vaspin and omentin in patients with JIA, and it shows that omentin is significantly higher in JIA patients in comparison with healthy controls. In addition, we also report that omentin plasma levels are significantly correlated with the presence and the number of active joints.

28477538	Journal Article	The increase in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) associated mortality is predominantly due to accelerated coronary artery and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis with increased risk of ischemic heart disease about 50% in RA patients compared to controls. To study the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease in RA, role of inflammatory cytokine interplay, disease activity and rheumatoid factor positivity. Eighty RA patients and 44 healthy controls were included. All subjects were younger than 45years for females and 55years for males with exclusion of all traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis. Interleukin (IL) 1, 6 and 18 were assessed in all subjects. RA patients fulfilled ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria and were subjected to Dobutaminestress-echocardiography, diseases activity assessed by DAS-28, X-ray hands for Larsen score and function assessment by HAQ. RA patients had significantly higher serum IL 1, 6 and 18 than controls (p=0.00 in all). Thirty four (42.5%) patients had hypertensive reaction on Dobutamine-stress-echocardiography, four of them had ischemic change, and 46 (57.5%) had normal reaction. All patients with hypertensive reaction had positive RF (p=0.00), 10 had DAS-28&gt;5.1, 20 had DAS-28 from 3.2 to5.1 and 4 were in remission (p=0.001). CRP was higher in patients with hypertensive reaction (p=0.003) while serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 showed no significant difference. In all patients, serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 showed significant positive correlation with VAS, HAQ and DAS-28 (p&lt;0.001 in all). Only IL18 showed significant positive correlation with X-ray score in all patients. Disease activity and RF positivity play an important risk factor for ischemic heart disease in RA. Serum levels of IL1, 6 and 18 did not help much in detecting patients at risk of ischemic heart disease. Better control of RA disease activity with early remission helps in preventing cardiac complications. More studies on larger number of patients are needed for better understanding of mechanism of ischemic heart disease in RA.

7497537	Journal Article	The systemic vasculitides are a group of rare inflammatory conditions resulting in inflammation and necrosis of blood vessel walls. They are somewhat commoner than previously believed with an annual incidence approaching 40 per million. Furthermore the annual incidence of rheumatoid vasculitis is 12.5 per million and Wegener\&#39;s granulomatosis is 8.5 per million. The first useful classification system for systemic vasculitis was published in 1952, since then a number of different schemes have been published. The major changes have been the recognition of the importance of dominant blood vessel size, the distinction between primary and secondary vasculitis and the incorporation of pathogenetic markers such as ANCA (see Table 6). Until relatively recently there were no widely agreed diagnostic or classification criteria. In 1990 the ACR published criteria for the diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener\&#39;s granulomatosis, hypersensitivity vasculitis, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu\&#39;s arteritis. The criteria were provided in both traditional and tree format. Sensitivity and specificity rates varied considerably: 71.0-95.3% for sensitivity and 78.7-99.7% for specificity. The criteria were not tested against the general population or against patients with other connective tissue diseases or rheumatic conditions. In 1993/94 the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference developed and published definitions for the nomenclature of systemic vasculitis based on clinical features. These have not met with universal acceptance. However, they are a useful addition, since their use should result in different centres studying more homogeneous populations of patients and facilitate comparison of data between different centres. Assessment of vasculitis comprises an activity score (BVAS), damage index and quality of life/health status (SF-36). These are recent developments which are still undergoing validation.

23221582	Journal Article	As more effective treatments for RA have become available, studies have demonstrated that in patients who attained remission, defined as a simplified disease activity index (SDAI) ≤3.3, not only disease activity but radiographic progression was reduced. The feasibility and the benefit of attaining remission led to the development of the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2011 remission criteria. These criteria employ either a Boolean definition, including tender and swollen joint counts ≤1, and CRP ≤1 mg/dl, or an index-based definition, SDAI ≤3.3, in combination with patient-reported outcomes on a scale of 0-10. It is expected that the ACR/EULAR criteria will be used as secondary outcomes in clinical trials. Some questions about the implementation of the new criteria include the availability of CRP values, and the possibility that patient-reported outcomes may skew the outcome if patients cannot distinguish other musculoskeletal conditions from RA. Several issues require further study, including the role of imaging, fatigue and the impact of the involvement of joints other than the 28 counted in the ACR/EULAR criteria.

25184745	Journal Article	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a highly familial rheumatic disorder and is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease. Genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of AS. To identify genes which render people susceptible to AS in a Taiwanese population, we selected six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) which were associated with AS in European descendants and Han Chinese. To assess whether the six SNPs contributed to AS susceptibility and severity in Taiwanese population, 475 AS patients fulfilling the modified New York Criteria and 527 healthy subjects were recruited. We found that rs10865331 was significantly associated with AS susceptibility and with Bath AS Function Index (BASFI). The AA and AG genotypes of rs10865331 were also significantly associated with a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Our findings provided evidence that rs10865331 is associated AS susceptibility and with disease activity (BASFI) in a Taiwanese population.

15969452	Journal Article	34th Greek regimen, which was part of the NATO forces, provided medical services to the civilians of Kosovo. We studied epidemiologic data in the population of Kosovo regarding hypertension in order to determine the prevalence and characteristics of hypertension. 830 patients (281 - 33.86% male, 62 +/- 26 yrs and 549 - 66.14% female, 49 +/- 28 yrs) were examined for different diseases. We identified 254 (30.6%) patients with hypertension (188 female and 66 male). According to the international criteria used for the classification of the severity of hypertension, more than half of the patients (51.2%) had severe hypertension, 31.5% modest and 17.3% mild. Statistically significant relation between the severity of hypertension and age or sex was not found out. Increased BMI as well as the presence of proteinuria and rheumatic diseases were significantly related to the severity of the hypertension while the coexistent heart disease, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) wasn\&#39;t. The use of non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) was related to the severity of hypertension with a borderline significance. 31.4% of the patients were on treatment with NSAIDs and/or cortisone because of rheumatic disease or obstructive pulmonary disease. Overfunction of the sympathetic system was present in 62.99%. The mean heart rate was greater in women (84/min) than in men (72/min). 28.35% of the patients had secondary hypertension, including the patients on a drug that can elevate the blood pressure and patients with increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. So, 8.6% of the patients had usual causes of secondary hypertension and 19.6% hypertension secondary related to the use of NSAIDs or cortisone, or due to the increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Antihypertensive treatment was started in 248 patients, i.e. in all of them except the ones already on treatment having their blood pressure well controlled. For antihypertensive treatment beta-blockers or central adrenergic inhibitors either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents were used most frequently combined with diuretics and Ca antagonists and ACE inhibitors. In conclusion the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in the population of Kosovo during the post war period had certain particularities.

28693070	Journal Article	&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; To explore the expression of Annexin a1 (AnxA1) mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from Naïve rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls and to investigate its influencing factors. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Thirty Naïve RA patients and 36 healthy controls were recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University between May 2013 and January 2015.All RA patients were fulfilled the classification criteria of ACR in 1987.Clinical characteristics and laboratory indexes were collected.Real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure AnxA1 and Foxp3 mRNA expression respectively.Serum TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-10 levels in each group was determined separately by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, correlations between the expression of AnxA1 mRNA and clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, Foxp3 mRNA, serum IL-17, TNF-α, IL-10 level in Naïve RA patients were analyzed. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The expressions of AnxA1 mRNA in PBMC of Naïve RA patients were lower than that of healthy controls [0.12 (0.05-0.30) versus 1.66 (0.40-2.68), &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05]. The Foxp3 mRNA expressions in PBMC of Naïve RA patients were also lower than that of healthy controls [0.77 (0.39-1.89) versus 2.93 (2.65-3.49), &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05], while serum TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-10 levels of Naïve RA patients were higher than those of healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05). The expression of AnxA1 was positively associated with the expression of Foxp3 mRNA (&lt;i&gt;r(s)&lt;/i&gt;=0.513, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) and negatively associated with the serum IL-17 level (&lt;i&gt;r(s)&lt;/i&gt;=-0.381, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05). But there were no correlations between expression of AnxA1 in PBMCs from Naïve RA patients with the TNF-α, IL-10 level, clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease duration and disease activity) and the laboratory indexes (RF, Anti-CCP antibody, ESR and CRP). The expression of Foxp3 mRNA and the serum IL-17 level was the independent influencing factor. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The reduced expression of AnxA1 may associate with the reduced expression of Foxp3 and the increased IL-17 level in Naïve RA patients.It suggested that AnxA1 may play a key role in immune regulation and anti-inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of RA.

27325125	Journal Article	Limited data are available about the ultrasound (US)-detected inflammatory features in patients with suspicion of inflammatory arthritis (S-IA) vs. established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our study aimed to assess if the presence of power Doppler (PD) can be predicted by a combination of clinical, laboratory and US parameters. We conducted a real-life, retrospective cohort study comparing clinical, laboratory and US parameters of 108 patients with established RA and 93 patients with S-IA. We propose a PD signal prediction model based on a beta-binomial distribution for PD variable using a mix of outcome measures. Patients with RA in clinical remission had significantly more active inflammation and erosions on US when compared with patients with S-IA with similar disease scores (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively); however, RA patients with different disease activity score (DAS-28) scores had similar PD scores (p = 0.058). The PD scores did not correlate with erosions (p = 0.38) or DAS-28 scores (p = 0.28) in RA patients, but they correlated with high disease activity in S-IA patients (p = 0.048). Subclinical inflammation is more common in patients with RA in clinical remission or with low disease activity than in patients with S-IA; therefore, US was more useful in assessing for true remission in RA rather than diagnosing IA in patients with low disease activity scores. This is the first study to propose a PD prediction model integrating several outcome measures in the two different groups of patients. Further research into validating this model can minimise the risk of underdiagnosing subclinical inflammation.

8912503	Comparative Study	To perform a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of low-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After identifying all relevant studies meeting preselected inclusion criteria, we performed 2 meta-analyses. First, we compared the effectiveness of prednisone to placebo and active drug controls (aspirin, chloroquine, or deflazacort) using standard meta-analysis methods for continuous data. Then, to compare the relative effectiveness of prednisone to second-line agents, we used methods similar to prior meta-analyses of second-line agents for RA treatment. Outcomes assessed were the number of tender and swollen joints, grip strength, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Very few studies directly assessed the effectiveness of corticosteroids for RA treatment, and many were of poor methodologic quality. Only 9 of 34 studies identified by our search met criteria for inclusion. The results of our standard meta-analysis indicated that corticosteroids appeared to be more effective than either placebo or active drug controls in improving most conventional outcome measures (effect size 0.90 for the number of tender joints, 1.05 for the number of swollen joints, and 1.20 for the ESR). In our second comparative meta-analysis, corticosteroids were nearly equivalent to second-line agents previously examined in meta-analyses (combined effect size 0.82). Based on the limited data available, during moderate-term treatment periods averaging slightly over 7 months, corticosteroids appeared to be as effective or more effective than alternative therapies in improving several common RA disease activity measures.

18388148	Journal Article	We monitored the mRNA expression profiles of peripheral blood cells during treatment with a TNF-alpha inhibitor, infliximab, in patients with RA. Using a DNA microarray analysis, we demonstrated a unique set of genes, with distinct baseline and post-treatment changes in expression between responders and non-responders to infliximab treatment. Using a customized low-density cDNA microarray with 747 genes and a reliable data collection system, we monitored the mRNA expression profiles of whole blood cells from 18 RA patients before and after the infusion of infliximab for up to 22 weeks. The clinical response to treatment with infliximab was determined using the ACR response criteria, the disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28), and individual clinical parameters. The patients were classified as responders or non-responders based on their ACR50% response at 22 weeks. Approximately 15% of the total genes were found to exhibit a &gt;1.5-fold change, compared with their reference values, at one or more time points during the 22 weeks of infliximab therapy. The expression of inflammatory genes, such as IFN-related genes, was strongly correlated with the serum level of CRP and the DAS28. The increased expression of inflammatory genes in responders was normalized within 2 weeks and then remained at a normal level during the treatment period. In contrast, in the non-responders, the elevated expression at baseline, although it was significantly decreased at 2 weeks, returned to the baseline level after 14 weeks. In addition to inflammatory genes, we identified several groups of genes with distinct differences in expression between the responders and non-responders. Our results suggest that a customized low-density microarray is useful for monitoring mRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood cells, enabling us to identify a unique set of genes with differentially regulated expressions in responders and non-responders to a TNF inhibitor among patients with RA.

17636694	Journal Article	Osteoarthritis (OA) affects a large portion of the population. Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a light source that generates extremely pure light, of a single wavelength. The effect is not thermal, but rather related to photochemical reactions in the cells. LLLT was introduced as an alternative non-invasive treatment for OA about 30 years ago, but its effectiveness has to be examined more closely, especially in the treatment of OA. To assess the effectiveness of class III LLLT for osteoarthritis when irradiation is directed at the osteoarthritic joint capsule. Searches were conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Musculoskeletal registry, the Rehabilitation and Related Therapies field registry and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register up to May, 2005. Following an a prior protocol, only controlled clinical trials of LLLT for the treatment of patients with a clinical diagnosis of OA were eligible. Abstracts lacking data were excluded unless further data could be obtained from the authors. Two reviewers independently selected trials and extracted data using predetermined forms. A fixed effects model was used throughout for continuous variables, except where heterogeneity existed; in which case, a random effects model was used. Results were analyzed as weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), whereas the difference between the treatment and control groups was weighted by the inverse of the variance. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated by dividing the difference between treatment and control by the baseline variance, and were used in the analysis of pain because different scales were used to measure it. Dichotomous outcomes were analyzed with relative risk (RR). Eight trials were included with 233 patients randomized to laser and 172 patients to placebo laser. Treatment duration ranged from two to six weeks. Pain was assessed in seven trials. When the results were pooled from different pain scales used in these seven trials, a statistically significant difference in favor of laser treatment was found with a SMD of -0.28 (95% CI: -0.48 to -0.09). One of these studies also measured pain during movement and found a statistically significant difference in favor of laser treatment with a WMD of -1.16 (95% CI: -2.02 to -0.30). Two studies found significant results for increased knee range of motion. Two others studies found a statistically significant difference in favor of laser treatment for patient-assessed global disease activity with laser compared to placebo (RR 1.70, 95%CI: 1.1. to 2.63). One trial evaluated the effectiveness of laser treatment in temporomandibular joint OA and found a statistically significant difference (WMD 38.69, 95% CI: 29.25 to 48.13) using the change in VAS score to measure pain. One study found a statistically significant difference in favor of laser treatment at the end of treatment and at 4 and 8 weeks post-treatment for morning stiffness. Other outcome measures of joint tenderness and strength did not yield significant differences. Five trials included in this review showed a statistically significant difference favoring laser treatment when compared to placebo for at least one outcome measure. Three trials did not report beneficial effects. The varying results of these trials may be due to the method of laser application and/or other features of LLLT application. Clinicians and researchers should consistently report the characteristics of LLLT devices and application techniques used. New trials on LLLT should make use of standardized, validated outcomes. There is clearly a need to investigate the effects of different dosages on LLLT effectiveness for OA in future randomized, controlled clinical trials. Also, more studies should be done to investigate the anti-inflammatory action of laser as well as the appropriate parameters needed to achieve an anti-inflammatory effect.

23945051	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that leads to joint damage, deformity, and pain. It affects approximately 1% of adults in developed countries. Periodontitis is a chronic oral infection, caused by inflammatory reactions to gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, and affecting about 35 to 50% of adults. If left untreated, periodontitis can lead to tooth loss. A significant association has been shown to exist between periodontitis and RA in observational studies. Some intervention studies have suggested that periodontal treatment can reduce serum inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We hypothesize that periodontitis could be an aggravating factor in patients with RA, and that its treatment would improve RA outcomes. The aim of this clinical trial is to assess the effect of periodontal treatment on the biological and clinical parameters of patients with RA. The ESPERA (Experimental Study of Periodontitis and Rheumatoid Arthritis) study is an open-label, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects with both RA and periodontitis will be recruited at two university hospitals in southwestern France. In total, 40 subjects will be randomized into two arms (intervention and control groups), and will be followed up for 3 months. Intervention will consist of full-mouth supra-gingival and sub-gingival non-surgical scaling and root planing, followed by systemic antibiotic therapy, local antiseptics, and oral hygiene instructions. After the 3-month follow-up period, the same intervention will be applied to the subjects randomized to the control group.The primary outcome will be change of in Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28) at the end of the follow-up period. Secondary outcomes will be the percentages of subjects with 20%, 50%, and 70% improvement in disease according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Health-related quality of life assessments (the Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index) will also be compared between the two groups. Evidence-based management of potential aggravating factors in subjects with active RA could be of clinical importance, yet there are few randomized controlled trials on the effect of periodontal treatment on the clinical parameters of RA. The ESPERA trial is designed to determine if non-surgical periodontal treatment could improve clinical outcomes in patients with active RA, and the quality of life of these patients. The ESPERA Trial was registered in Current Controlled Trials [ISRCTN79186420] on 2012/03/20. The trial started recruiting on 2012/03/06.

21658310	Journal Article	Autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor, RF; anti-citrullinated-protein antibodies, ACPA) and complement system are involved in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). ACPA and anti-TNF agents are capable of in vitro modulating complement activity. We investigated the relationships between complement, autoantibodies, and anti-TNF treatment in vivo. One-hundred fourteen RA patients (89F/25M), diagnosed according to 1987 ACR criteria, and 30 healthy controls were enrolled. Serological analysis included ESR, CRP, complement C3, C4 and CH50, RF and ACPA (ELISA, cut-off&gt;20 U/ml). Split-products (SP) of C3 and B were studied by immunoelectrophoresis/counterimmunoelectrophoresis. Seventy-six patients started anti-TNF treatment and were studied at baseline and after 22 weeks. Disease activity was measured with DAS28 and response to therapy with EULAR criteria. At baseline, RA patients showed significantly higher levels of C3 and C4 than controls (C3 127.9±26.5 vs 110±25 mg/dl, P=0.0012; C4 29.7±10.2 vs 22.7±8.3mg/dl, P=0.0003). No differences in C3, C4 and CH50 levels were observed between ACPA+ (n=76) and ACPA- (n=38) patients. After 22 weeks of anti-TNF, C3, C4 and RF were significantly reduced (P&lt;0.003, &lt;0.005 and &lt;0.04, respectively) and RF changes showed negative correlation with CH50. SP of C3 and B were observed neither at baseline nor after 22 weeks. DAS28 significantly improved after 22 weeks. Patients showing higher baseline C3 or lower reduction of C3 levels after 22 weeks had a worse EULAR outcome (X2=22.793, P&lt;0.001). RF levels seem to correlate with complement CH50. The presence of high levels of C3 in RA patients may reflect a pro-inflammatory status and represent a negative prognostic factor for anti-TNF therapy.

21909946	Journal Article	Earlier studies revealed that visual feedback has contributed in the management of neuromuscular as well as psychiatric disorders; however, it has not yet been applied in rheumatology. Visual feedback is a relatively new tool that enables the patient to visualize as well as monitor a real-time change of their disease activity parameters as well as the patient\&#39;s reported outcome measures. Integrating electronic data recording in the standard rheumatology clinical practice made visual feedback possible. To evaluate the feasibility of using the visual feedback in patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EA) and how ubiquitous computing technology can improve the patients\&#39; compliance and adherence to therapy, this was a double-blind randomized controlled study, which included 111 patients diagnosed to have EA according to the new ACR/EULAR criteria. All patients received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) therapy and monitored regularly over the period of 1 year. By the 6th month of treatment, the patients were randomly allocated to an active group (55 patients) to whom the visual feedback (visualization of charts showing the progression of disease activity parameters) was added to their management protocol, and a control group (56 patients) who continued their standard management protocols. The patients were monitored for another 6-months period. All the patient\&#39;s disease activity parameters, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), medications, scores of falls, and cardiovascular risks were recorded electronically. Primary outcome was the change in the patients\&#39; adherence to their medications, disease activity score (DAS-28), and PROMs: pain score, patient global assessment, functional disability, and quality of life. Secondary outcome was the answers to a questionnaire completed by every patient in both the active group and control group (using Visual Analogue Scale) by the end of 1 year of management, to rate from the patient\&#39;s perspective the impact of the management protocol, whether using the standard or visual feedback approach, on them and their disease. The visual feedback provided a significant greater reduction in disease activity parameters as well as improvement of the patients\&#39; adherence to antirheumatic therapy (P &lt; 0.01). Also stopping the DMARDs therapy because of intolerance was significantly less in the active group. Concerns about the future was significantly less in the active group whereas inability to coup with daily life and disease stress were significantly more among the control group. The improvement of disease activity parameters was associated with improvement in functional disability and quality of life scores. Mean changes in disease parameters showed no significant differences at 3-6 months of therapy but differences were statistically significant at 12-months follow-up (P &lt; 0.01). Medication compliance was significantly correlated with changes in all measured disease parameters. By recording and monitoring disease activity parameters electronically and incorporating the visual feedback approach into clinical practice, a new experience can be created. Visual feedback enabled the patients to see how they are doing regarding their disease activity and helps to optimize their adherence to their treatment. Visual feedback had a positive and significant impact on the disease activity control.

15878903	Journal Article	To assess the prevalence of inflammation in subjects with chronic painful knee osteoarthritis (OA), as determined by the presence of synovitis or joint effusion at ultrasonography (US); and to evaluate the correlation between synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters. A cross sectional, multicentre, European study was conducted under the umbrella of EULAR-ESCISIT. had primary chronic knee OA (ACR criteria) with pain during physical activity &gt;or=30 mm for at least 48 hours. Clinical parameters were collected by a rheumatologist and an US examination of the painful knee was performed by a radiologist or rheumatologist within 72 hours of the clinical examination. Ultrasonographic synovitis was defined as synovial thickness &gt;or=4 mm and diffuse or nodular appearance, and a joint effusion was defined as effusion depth &gt;or=4 mm. 600 patients with painful knee OA were analysed. At US 16 (2.7%) had synovitis alone, 85 (14.2%) had both synovitis and effusion, 177 (29.5%) had joint effusion alone, and 322 (53.7%) had no inflammation according to the definitions employed. Multivariate analysis showed that inflammation seen by US correlated statistically with advanced radiographic disease (Kellgren-Lawrence grade &gt;or=3; odds ratio (OR)=2.20 and 1.91 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively), and with clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of an inflammatory \&quot;flare\&quot;, such as joint effusion on clinical examination (OR=1.97 and 2.70 for synovitis and joint effusion, respectively) or sudden aggravation of knee pain (OR=1.77 for joint effusion). US can detect synovial inflammation and effusion in painful knee OA, which correlate significantly with knee synovitis, effusion, and clinical parameters suggestive of an inflammatory \&quot;flare\&quot;.

17762848	Journal Article	Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that predominantly affects the axial skeleton in adolescent patients causing spinal pain and stiffness. There is a marked delay, on average 8 years, between onset of disease symptoms and clinical diagnosis. The distinction between the symptoms of mechanical and inflammatory back pain remains one of the main contributing factors for the delay in diagnosis. Several classification criteria exist to aid the diagnosis of AS, but their accuracy is poor. The Ankylosing Spondylitis Assessment Study group (ASAS) has defined a core set of domains for clinical outcome measurement in AS in order to assess the disease process in individual patients and to identify those with rapidly progressive disease. New therapies, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, have transformed the treatment paradigm in AS, especially for those patients with aggressive disease. Thus, the definition of both patient selection criteria for these agents and the development of clinical methods to assess response to therapy have become a priority. This Review focuses on measuring the degree of disease activity, function and damage in patients with AS in an ambulatory care setting, and the assessment of suitability of various outcome measures for monitoring response to treatment with TNF inhibitors.

28511291	Comparative Study	To compare disease activity and disability over 2 years in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) before and after implementation of treat-to-target therapy and identify predictors of adverse outcome. The Yorkshire Early Arthritis Register (YEAR) recruited 725 patients with early RA between 2002 and 2009, treated with a step-up approach. The Inflammatory Arthritis Continuum study (IACON) recruited cases between 2010 and 2014 and treated to target. A total of 384 IACON cases met 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria. Latent growth curves of change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) were compared between YEAR and IACON. Latent class growth analysis identified trajectories of change. Baseline predictors of trajectories were identified using logistic regression. The mean DAS28 over 2 years was lower in IACON than in YEAR. Latent trajectories of HAQ change in YEAR were high stable (21% of cohort), moderate reducing (35%), and low reducing (44%). Only moderate reducing (66%) and low reducing (34%) were seen in IACON. In both cohorts, female sex and fatigue predicted adverse HAQ trajectories (high stable and moderate reducing). Odds ratios (ORs) for moderate reducing compared to low reducing for women were 2.58 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.69, 4.49) in YEAR and 5.81 (95% CI 2.44, 14.29) in IACON. ORs per centimeter fatigue visual analog score were 1.13 (95% CI 1.07, 1.20) in YEAR and 1.16 (95% CI 1.12, 1.20) in IACON. Treat-to-target therapy gave more favorable trajectories of change in DAS28 and HAQ, but adverse HAQ trajectory was more likely in women with greater fatigue, suggesting such patients would benefit from interventions to improve function as well as reduce inflammation.

16127769	Journal Article	Serum rheumatoid factor (RF) is important in the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical characteristics and treatment patterns of RA according to the presence of RF in Korean patients. A retrospective analysis was performed on the records of 109 patients who were followed for at least 2 years, among 230 RA patients who visited at the rheumatology clinic in Ajou University Hospital and who fulfilled the 1987 revised American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. Sixty-four patients were RF positive (58.7%) and 91 patients were female (83.5%). There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics, joint involvements, or percentage of morning stiffness between seropositive and seronegative groups. Antinuclear antibody was detected more frequently in the seropositive group (p &lt; 0.05). At initial diagnosis, the seropositive group had higher white blood cell and platelet counts than the seronegative group (p &lt; 0.01). However, the difference was disappeared at the last follow-up. Inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP were also higher at diagnosis in the seropositive group (p &lt; 0.01). These inflammatory markers were still greater than the seronegative group at the last follow-up (p &lt; 0.01). There was no significant difference in the use of disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and steroid dosage between groups. However, DMARD combination therapy was more commonly used in the seropositive group (p &lt; 0.05), especially triple DMARD combination. These results suggest that disease activity is more severe in the seropositive than the seronegative group, and more aggressive treatments are needed in the seropositive group.

29202486	Journal Article	Recent epidemiological studies suggested an association between a poor vitamin D [25(OH)D] status, inflammatory mediators, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We have recently proposed that pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) may represent a good marker for disease activity of RA. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and disease activity, joint damage, as well as serum IL-6 levels in a Polish RA population. Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured in 35 female RA patients and 38 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Statistical correlations between 25(OH)D levels and the disease activity score 28 (DAS 28), joint damage based on the Steinbrocker criteria, as well as serum IL-6 levels were performed. There was no statistically significant difference between levels of 25(OH)D in RA (16.89±8.57 ng/ml) and healthy controls (14.12±7.51 ng/ml), and the vitamin D deficiency (&lt;20 ng/ml) was found in 71.43% of RA patients and 73.68 % of healthy controls. While vitamin D status did not correlate with DAS 28 (r=0.265, p=0.149) and joint damage based on the Steinbrocker criteria (r=0.367, p=0.065), a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and IL-6 (r=0.537, p=0.002) was observed in RA. Although further studies on a larger group of patients will be needed to confirm the data presented here, it seems that hypovitaminosis D is common in the RA patients and middle-aged non-RA healthy women in the Polish population. 25(OH)D levels were similar in the RA patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls, and were not associated with joint damage and disease activity in patients.

25365082	Journal Article	Counting the number of tender and swollen joints is an important aspect of assessing patients with an inflammatory arthritis. We provide a comprehensive overview of joint counts in inflammatory arthritis. This spans how they are undertaken, their use in clinical and research settings, their limitations and standardisation and who can perform them. We reviewed the literature surrounding joint counts in inflammatory arthropathies, with a specific focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The current widely used joint count assesses 28 peripheral joints. In RA these are usually incorporated in a composite score of disease activity, termed the disease activity score on a 28-joint count (DAS28). Assessing 28 joints has a strong \&#39;floor-effect\&#39; with most patients in routine practice having low swollen and tender joint counts. Marked between-observer variation exists in joint count scores; although the variation in tender joint counts can be reduced by standardised training its impact on swollen joint counts is uncertain. Fibromyalgia can have a marked impact on tender joint count scores, resulting in a disproportionately high tender joint count to swollen joint count ratio. Although there is evidence that patient-assessed tender joint counts correlate well with those undertaken by physicians, patients are limited assessors of synovitis. Although joint counts provide an important objective measure of disease activity in clinical practice, they have a number of limitations. Future research may provide a more robust clinical assessment for disease activity in inflammatory arthropathies, which overcomes these issues.

10911466	English Abstract	The mean time from initiation of methotrexate (MTX) treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) to partial remission of clinical symptoms and total clinical remission was assessed. 9 girls and 8 boys, from 3 to 18 years of age (mean 11.4 +/- 5.4) with active JRA by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (5 systemic, 8 polyarticular and 4 pauciarticular disease onset), who failed to respond to adequate courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), steroids or disease-modifying drugs were studied. Clinic visits were scheduled at monthly intervals for physical and laboratory assessment of disease activity and drug safety. Partial response to MTX was defined a 25% reduction of the active joint count and/or articular severity score. Total clinical remission was defined as in adult rheumatoid arthritis. The duration of disease activity until enrollment ranged from 6 months to 14 years (4.5 +/- 3.7 yr); duration of therapy was 3 months to 3 years (14.6 +/- 9.3 mo) and dosage ranged from 5 to 15 mg/m2/week. Prednisone in doses below 10 mg/day and NSAID were permitted. 14 of 17 patients (82%) had a 25% reduction in joint activity after 6 weeks to 4 months (9.2 +/- 3.2 weeks); 10 (59%) went into full clinical remission after 5 to 26 months (14.3 +/- 9 months); 3 relapsed after an initial response to treatment, and 4 (23%) did not respond to MTX. The non-responders were males who required higher doses of prednisone (p &lt; 0.0001). MTX appears to be effective therapy for children with JRA. An initial response can be expected in most patients after 9 weeks of treatment, and full clinical remission occurs after a mean of 14 months.

27553659	Journal Article	Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) plays important roles in many biological functions, such as, stimulation of contractility in the heart, vasodilation, promoting neuroendocrine-immune communication, lowering arterial blood pressure, and anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory activity. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative bone disease, which is one of the most common causes of disability and most common in both sexes as people become older. Interestingly VIP can prevent chronic cartilage damage and joint remodeling. This review article provides update information on the association of VIP and OA and its treatment. Evidences suggest that VIP is down-regulated in synovial fluid of OA, and VIP down-regulation leads to increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that might contribute to the pathogenesis of OA; however contradictory reports also exist suggesting that accumulation of VIP in joints can also contribute OA. A number of studies indicated that up-regulation of VIP can counteract the action of pro-inflammatory stimuli and alleviate the pain in OA. More clinical investigations are necessary to determine the biology of VIP and its therapeutic potential in OA that might represent the future standards of care for OA.

21536151	Journal Article	Anti-TNFα blockers have rapidly become a standard treatment for rheumatoid (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) because of their acceptable safety profile and efficacy. Clinical and radiological remission may now be a realistic outcome and constitutes the best achievable state. However, clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements on the criteria of introduction, duration and cessation of treatment are under constant revision. Evidence supports that the early use of biologic DMARDs would produce rapid and sustained suppression of inflammatory disease and preserve function and joint erosions. Proof of this concept, anti-TNFα agents would be effective in maintaining response after cessation of treatment. Conversely, when therapy with anti-TNFα is withdrawn, the disease rapidly returns. Remission may be defined as minimal or no clinically detectable disease activity in the presence of continuing drug treatment and a rapid control of disease activity may prevent irreversible damage and disability. The use of US-PD and MRI in the early detection of disease recurrence could become necessary to prevent the relapse and direct the clinician\&#39;s choice concerning a re-treatment regimen. The use of biological treatment can be for a limited period, at a time when it has the greatest opportunity to make the difference.

25798875	Journal Article	To study the association between the baseline IL-33 and soluble ST2 (sST2) levels with disease remission and progression of carotid atherosclerosis in early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) patients. A total of 98 ERA patients were enrolled. Disease activity and the presence of carotid plaque were evaluated at baseline and 12 months later. Plasma IL-33 and sST2 levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Baseline IL-33 and sST2 levels were associated with inflammatory markers and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. Overall, 44(45%), 18(18%), and 21(21%) patients achieved remission based on 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28), Boolean, and simplified disease activity score (SDAI) criteria at 12 months, respectively. Patients with detectable IL-33 at baseline were less likely to achieve DAS28 (P = 0.010) and SDAI remission (P = 0.021), while a lower baseline sST2 level was able to predict DAS28, Boolean, and SDAI remission (P = 0.005, 0.001, and &lt;0.001, respectively). Using multivariate analysis, a lower baseline sST2 level independently predict Boolean (OR = 0.789; P = 0.005) and SDAI remission (0.812; P = 0.008). Regarding carotid atherosclerosis, 9/98(9.2%) patients had plaque progression at 12 months. Baseline IL-33 was detectable in 8/9(89%) and 42/83(51%) of patients with and without plaque progression respectively (P = 0.029). Baseline detectable IL-33 was an independent predictor for plaque progression after adjusting for traditional CV risk factors (P = 0.017). Lower baseline sST2 levels independently predict disease remission and baseline detectable IL-33 independently predicts carotid plaque progression in ERA patients. This study suggests that inflammation induced by the IL-33/ST2 axis may play a significant role in the development of cardiovascular disease in RA.

23937715	Journal Article	Cardiac conduction disturbances are common in spondyloarthropathies such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Whether their occurrence can be linked to signs and symptoms of rheumatic disease activity is an unsettled issue addressed in this study. In this cross-sectional study patients with AS according to modified New York criteria but without psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, dementia, pregnancy, other severe diseases such as malignancy and difficulties in answering questionnaires were invited; and 210 participated (120 men), mean age 49 years (SD 13; range: 16-77). Questionnaires, physical examination, ECG, and laboratory tests were performed at the same visit. Cardiac conduction disturbances were common and diagnosed in 10-33%, depending on if conservative or less conservative predefined criteria were applied. They consisted mostly of 1st degree atrio-ventricular block and prolonged QRS duration, but one patient had a pacemaker and 7 more had complete bundle branch blocks. Conduction abnormalities were associated mainly with age, male gender and body weight, and not with laboratory measures of inflammation or with Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Neither were they associated with the presence of HLA B27, which was found in 87% of all patients; the subtype B270502 dominated in all patients. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are common in AS, but not associated with markers of disease activity or specific B27 subtypes. Even relatively mild conduction system abnormalities might, however, indirectly affect morbidity and mortality.

29064817	Journal Article	Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem disorder of the connective tissue characterized by a great deal of heterogeneity. This variability is a result of a combination of vascular damage inflammation and fibrosis leading to internal organ complications. The pathogenesis of disorder is still unknown. A large part is given to genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. There is ongoing research into the new cells and mediators involved in the complicated development of disease. The overlap of vascular, autoimmune/ inflammatory alternations and fibrosis causes the multidirectional and unpredictable course of disease. Vascular complications may dominate in one group, whereas fibrosis in others. In addition, the disorder is characterized by individual variability; therefore although certain prognostic markers do exist, the course of disorder in largely unpredictable. This complexity of SSc, makes it difficult in terms of diagnosis and activity assessment, especially in early stages. Over a number of years, further classification criteria, which were more sensitive and more specific, were developed. The 2013 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology - EULAR/ACR classification criteria for SSc, were revised to include diagnosis in early stages and particularly in limited SSc. Unfortunately, there still exist certain groups of population which do not fulfil these criteria but develop the disorder; therefore, the search for new diagnostic methods which could elevate SSc diagnosis continues.

Pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline in urine were analyzed by HPLC, levels of CrP and ESR were estimated using laboratory assessment. - Both crosslinks show a elevated excretion in PsA (particularly in active PsA / aPsA) as well as in RA. PS and Controls show no significant difference in the elimination of crosslinks. The levels of both crosslinks are higher in females than males in all groups. With the exception of Dpyd levels in urine which only show a tendency to correlate with ESR, there are positive correlations between measured crosslink-levels in urine and markers of inflammation. The Pyd/Dpyd ratio displays a significant correlation with ESR. - An increased breakdown of collagen I and II was found only in active forms of psoriatic arthritis and in rheumatoid arthritis. Our biochemical results do not demonstrate a complete agreement with former scintigraphic or histological investigations of other authors and own histomorphological results.

20556817	Clinical Trial, Phase II	Selective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) agonists have demonstrated relevant antiinflammatory effects in different animal models. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of one of these agonists, ERB-041, in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 291 patients with active RA receiving stable doses of methotrexate were randomized to receive 5, 25, or 75 mg of ERB-041 or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR20) at 12 weeks. Secondary end points included the ACR 50% improvement criteria (ACR50) and the ACR 70% improvement criteria (ACR70) responses, health outcomes measures, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and potential exposure-response relationships. Medical history, physical examination, and laboratory values were obtained at screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. No statistically significant difference for the ACR20 was found between the ERB-041 treatment and placebo groups (P = 0.518). Nor was a significant difference observed for ACR50 and ACR70 responses, health outcomes measures, CRP levels, and overall incidence of adverse events among all groups. Forty-four subjects (15.1%) discontinued the study and the rate of discontinuation was similar among the treatment groups. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were headache (7.6%), nausea (6.2%), infection (4.8%), and bronchitis (4.1%). None of the adverse events was considered treatment related. Although well tolerated and safe, ERB-041 failed to demonstrate antiinflammatory efficacy in RA patients, despite evidence of strong activity in preclinical arthritis models. These results suggest that selective ERβ agonists would not have effects on regulating inflammatory response in RA. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to establish their efficacy in inflammatory arthritis.

30424767	Journal Article	Epimedium sagittatum (Sieb.et Zucc.) Maxim., Ying-Yang-Huo in Chinese has been used as a traditional Chinese medicine and is deemed to \&quot;reinforce the kidney Yang\&quot;. Previous studies showed that E. sagittatum could modulate the immune system and treat some chronic disease such as rheumatic arthritis, cardiovascular diseases and osteoporosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of ethyl acetate extracts (YYHs) of E. sagittatum and its mechanisms of action. In order to explore the composition of YYHs, YYHs was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and in comparison with reference standards. Anti-inflammatory model was established in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. The levels of nitric oxide (NO) were measured with the Griess reagent. Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In addition, expression of p-p65 protein and TLR4/MD-2 complex was detected by western blots and flow cytometric, respectively. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) nuclear translocation was observed by fluorescence microscope. A total of eight compounds were identified, of which icariside II was the most abundant compound. YYHs (12.5-50 μg/mL) had no obvious cytotoxic effect on cells, and remarkably inhibited LPS-induced production of NO, TNF-α and IL-2 with a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, YYHs up-regulated expression of p-p65 and TLR4/MD-2 complex. Further research showed that YYHs significantly suppressed NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation. In brief, YYHs contributed to the inhibition of LPS-induced inflammatory response through the TLR4/MD-2-mediated NF-κB pathway and may be a potential choice to combat inflammation diseases. It includes a schema of pathways at the end of the paper.

25179377	Journal Article	Evidences indicate that oxidative stress and inflammation are important processes in the development of destructive synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The two major bioscavenger enzymes that are associated with inflammation and oxidative stress are human-butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) and paraoxonase-1 (PON-1). Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the relation of BuChE phenotypes and PON-1 Q192R polymorphism with inflammatory markers such as anti-cytroline circulated peptide (CCP)-antibodies, CRP, neopterin, DAS28-CRP in RA patients. In this study, we examined association of BuChE-phenotypes and activity, PON192rs662 (Q192R) polymorphism and its arylesterase activity (ARE) with systemic-inflammatory-markers and oxidative stress. The present case-control study consisted of 419-RA patients and 398 gender-age-matched unrelated healthy controls from west population of Iran. PON192rs662 polymorphism was detected by real-time-PCR. BuChE phenotype, TAC level, serum BuChE and ARE activities were determined spectrophotometrically. Anti-CCP-antibody and CRP were measured by ELISA and neopterin level was detected by HPLC. We used the EULAR activity criteria to measure DAS28-CRP. We found that PON-1-Q192R was associated with severity of RA [remission-to-low and moderate-to-high in dominant Q/Q+Q/R vs. R/R: OR=2.27, p&lt;0.001; codominant Q/Q vs. R/R: OR=1.65, p&lt;0.001 and Q/R vs. R/R: OR=2.12, p=0.003; recessive Q/Q vs. R/R+Q/R: OR=1.79, p=0.032; and allele Q vs. R: OR=1.68, p&lt;0.001] and presence of anti-CCP-antibody (codominant model Q/Q vs. R/R: OR=1.28, p=0.042). The carriers of Q/Q genotype PON-1-Q192R and BuChE non-UU-phenotype had higher ARE activity, serum levels of neopterin, anti-CCP antibody titer and number of tender-joint and lower activity of BuChE and serum level of TAC than that of R/R genotype and BuChE-UU-phenotype. The current findings demonstrate for the first time that there is a link between systemic inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, the PON192rs662-Q allele and BuChE-non-UU-phenotype and their corresponding enzymatic activity which may be considered as a risk factor for the severity of RA for a population in Iran.

3098194	Clinical Trial	Superoxide dismutase activity (SOD), plasma and lysate thiol concentrations (PSH and LSH), and caeruloplasmin oxidase activity (CP) reflect the underlying reduction-oxidation imbalance associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and are believed to be involved in the protection of the cell against free radical activity. The early and late changes in these parameters have been observed and compared with standard clinical and biochemical assessments of disease activity in 90 patients with active RA, randomly assigned to receive either sodium aurothiomalate, auranofin, or auranofin placebo. An index based on clinical criteria was used to identify patients as responders or non-responders after 24 weeks of therapy. In the first six weeks of treatment a change in SOD activity and LSH concentration in a direction away from controls was followed by a return towards control levels in responders only. This suggests that in RA evidence of clinical improvement induced by gold drugs is preceded by an initial biochemical response in an inflammatory direction. The extracellular parameters PSH and CP did not show the same early response, but PSH levels in responders showed a slower change towards normal values, though at no time were values obtained that might suggest a complete remission. Thus the intracellular parameters appear to reflect an early effect of the drugs on cells which may possibly be of use in predicting the outcome of therapy, whereas the extracellular parameters provide confirmatory evidence for an eventual improvement.

25394817	Journal Article	Pain in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is traditionally considered to be of inflammatory origin. Despite better control of inflammation, some patients still report pain as a significant concern, even when being in clinical remission. This suggests that RA may prompt central sensitisation-one aspect of chronic pain. In contrast, other patients report good treatment response, although imaging shows signs of inflammation, which could indicate a possible enhancement of descending pain inhibitory mechanisms. When assessing disease activity in patients with central sensitisation, the commonly used disease activity scores (eg, DAS28-CRP (C reactive protein)) will yield constant high total scores due to high tender joint count and global health assessments, whereas MRI provides an isolated estimate of inflammation. The objective of this study is, in patients with RA initiating anti-inflammatory treatment, to explore the prognostic value of a screening questionnaire for central sensitisation, hand inflammation assessed by conventional MRI, and the interaction between them regarding treatment outcome evaluated by clinical status (DAS28-CRP). For the purpose of further exploratory analyses, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is performed. The painDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ), originally developed to screen for a neuropathic pain component, is applied to indicate the presence of central sensitisation. Adults diagnosed with RA are included when either (A) initiating disease-modifying antirheumatic drug treatment, or (B) initiating or switching to biological therapy. We anticipate that 100 patients will be enrolled, tested and reassessed after 4 months of treatment. Clinical data, conventional MRI, DCE-MRI, blood samples and patient-reported outcomes. This study aims at supporting rheumatologists to define strategies to reach optimal treatment outcomes in patients with RA based on chronic pain prognostics. The study has been approved by The Capital region of Denmark\&#39;s Ethics Committee; identification number H-3-2013-049. The results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals.

Each patient received twelve intra-articular injections at biweekly intervals of orgotein (2 mg) or placebo dissolved in about 2 ml saline injection, USP. No other antiinflammatory medications were permitted. By the end of the trial, significant efficacy of orgotein over placebo had been reached in the parameters of pain, functional improvement and evaluation of status both by physician and patient. With the orgotein dose regimen used, improvement of disease activity versus time progressed with a fairly constant slope. In the placebo group a surprisingly large initial response was observed which lasted as long as 12 weeks in some instances before subsiding.

21996338	Comparative Study	Fatigue is prevalent in primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (pSS), and contributes to the considerably reduced health related quality of life in this disease. The symptom is included in proposed disease activity and outcome measures for pSS. Several studies indicate that there is an inflammatory component of fatigue in pSS and other chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate fatigue change in pSS in a longitudinal study, and explore whether any clinical or laboratory variables at baseline, including serum cytokines, were associated with a change in fatigue scores over time. A clinical and laboratory investigation of 141 patients fulfilling the American-European consensus criteria of pSS was undertaken in the period May 2004 to April 2005. Median time since diagnosis was 5.5 years. Examinations included the fatigue questionnaires: fatigue severity scale (FSS), fatigue visual analogue scale (VAS), functional assessment of chronic illness therapy-fatigue (FACIT-F) and medical outcome study short form-36 (SF-36) vitality, which were repeated in a follow-up investigation in January and February 2010. A total of 122 patients (87%) responded at both time-points. Thirty-five percent of patients experienced a clinically significant FSS increase. On the group level, fatigue measures did not change except that there was a slight deterioration in SF-36 vitality score. High serum anti-Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome A antigen (anti-SSA) showed weak associations with high baseline fatigue, and patients with increasing fatigue had lower baseline unstimulated whole salivary volume. Weak associations between increasing fatigue and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 (IL-17), were observed. Baseline sicca symptoms correlated with higher fatigue both at baseline and with increasing fatigue over time. Linear regression analysis did not identify any predictive ability of clinical or laboratory measures on fatigue change over time. Fatigue remained mainly unchanged over time. Using multivariate models did not reveal any clinical or laboratory predictors of fatigue change over time.

27652504	Journal Article	The past decade has seen many successes in translational rheumatology, from dramatic improvements in outcomes brought about by novel biologic therapies, to the discovery of new monogenic inflammatory disorders. Advances in molecular medicine, combined with progress towards precision care, provide an excellent opportunity to accelerate the translation of biological understanding to the bedside. However, although the field of rheumatology is a leader in the standardization of data collection and measures of disease activity, it lags behind in standardization of biological sample collection and assay performance. Uniform approaches are necessary for robust collaborative research, particularly in rare diseases. Standardization is also critical to increase reproducibility between centres, a prerequisite for clinical implementation of translational research. This Perspectives article emphasizes the need for standardization and implementation of best practices, presented in the context of lessons learned from international biorepository networks.

27515300	Comparative Study	We examined pain levels in 2 cohorts assembled from the British Society for Rheumatology Biologics Register (BSRBR), and investigated which factors predicted Bodily Pain scores and discontinuation of TNFα-inhibitors. Data were retrieved from BSRBR-RA databases for up to 1 year after commencing TNFα-inhibitors (n = 11995) or being treated with non-biologic therapies (n = 3632). Bodily Pain scores were derived from the Short Form-36 (SF36) questionnaire and norm-transformed to allow comparison with UK population averages. Discontinuation data were from physician reports. Other data, including 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) measurements, were from clinical examination, interview, medical records and self-report questionnaires. DAS28-P was derived as the proportion of DAS28 attributed to patient-reported factors (tender joint count and visual analogue score). Missing baseline variables from both cohorts were imputed into 20 replicate datasets. Odds ratios (OR) and adjusted OR were calculated for higher than median pain within each cohort. Participants reported moderate to severe pain at baseline, and pain scores remained &gt;1SD worse than normal population standards at 1 year, even when disease activity responded to treatment. Baseline pain was associated with DAS28-P, worse physical function, worse mental health, and DAS28. After logistic regression, independent predictors of higher than median pain at follow up were baseline Bodily Pain score, higher DAS28-P, worse physical function or mental health and co-morbidities. Higher age, male gender, and higher BMI were additional independent predictors of higher pain in participants who received TNFα-inhibitors. Baseline pain was also one of the predictors of discontinuation of the first TNFα-inhibitor within 1 year, as were female gender, current smoking, co-morbidities, extra-articular manifestations and worse function. Pain persists in people with treated RA, even in those for whom inflammation responds to treatment. Worse pain outcomes are predicted by factors different to those typically found to predict inflammatory disease activity in other studies. Worse pain at baseline also predicts discontinuation of TNFα-inhibitors. Improved pain management should complement inflammatory disease suppression in RA.

19211043	Journal Article	To identify the clinical factors predicting failure or a good clinical response in the cohort of RA patients entered in the Lombardy Rheumatology Network (LORHEN) registry after 3 years of treatment with anti-TNF agents. We studied the patients who had received anti-TNF agents and been followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Disease activity at baseline and after 6 months was assessed using the DAS28, and response was evaluated according to the EULAR improvement criteria. 1005 patients (55.72 years) were included in the analysis. at baseline the DAS-28 was 5.91+/-0.95 and a HAQ score was 1.46+/-0.61. At mean of 14.57 months, 29.9% of the patients achieved a DAS-28 of &lt;or=2.6 (remission). A higher RR for remission was associated with male gender (AHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.14-2.00; p: 0.004) and a lower RR for remission with: prior treatment with &gt;3 DMARDs (AHR 0.077, 95% CI 0.58-1.03; p: 0.074), a high ESR (AHR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.92; p: 0.000), Steinbrocker\&#39;s functional class III/IV (AHR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.90; p: 0.010), a high TJC (AHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.99; p: 0.011).

23941289	Journal Article	This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this ongoing cohort, 172 patients with active RA who had inadequate responses to traditional medication were enrolled. Patients were divided into two groups for different treatment: disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) plus medium without UC-MSCs, or DMARDs plus UC-MSCs group (4×10(7) cells per time) via intravenous injection. Adverse events and the clinical information were recorded. Tests for serological markers to assess safety and disease activity were conducted. Serum levels of inflammatory chemokines/cytokines were measured, and lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood were analyzed. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after infusion. The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 decreased after the first UC-MSCs treatment (P&lt;0.05). The percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells of peripheral blood was increased (P&lt;0.05). The treatment induced a significant remission of disease according to the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria, the 28-joint disease activity score, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire. The therapeutic effects maintained for 3-6 months without continuous administration, correlating with the increased percentage of regulatory T cells of peripheral blood. Repeated infusion after this period can enhance the therapeutic efficacy. In comparison, there were no such benefits observed in control group of DMARDS plus medium without UC-MSCs. Thus, our data indicate that treatment with DMARDs plus UC-MSCs may provide safe, significant, and persistent clinical benefits for patients with active RA.

Prospective non-interventional study with 24-month observation per patient. 158 office-based and clinical-based physicians in Germany. GLM administered in the 50 mg dose subcutaneously in monthly intervals under real-life conditions. Of the 1613 included patients, 1458 patients were eligible for final analysis: 474 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 54.9±13.4 years, 72.8% women, 64.7% biologic-naïve), 501 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA, 50.5±12.1 years, 54.1% women, 56.5% biologic-naïve) and 483 with ankylosing spondylitis (AS, 43.6±12.3 years, 66.5% men, 61.0% biologic-naïve). 664 patients completed follow-up (2-year retention rate 45.5%). Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) decreased from 5.0 to 2.9 after 24 months (p&lt;0.0001) in patients with RA, and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Index score decreased from 5.1 to 2.4 (p&lt;0.0001) in patients with AS. Response rate calculated in patients with PsA by modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria was 67.9% after 24 months. Most adverse events were of mild or moderate nature, and no new safety signals were detected. According to the physicians\&#39; clinical assessments, treatment with GLM was successful (no adverse drug reaction and a clear or moderate therapeutic effect in an individual patient) in 55.0%-56.6% of patients with RA, PsA and AS, respectively, at month 3, increasing from 74.5% to 76.1% at month 24. GLM subcutaneously once monthly led to substantial improvements in clinical effectiveness in patients with various inflammatory rheumatic diseases who could be followed up in a real-life setting in Germany. The treatment was well tolerated, and the safety profile of GLM was consistent with that observed in the previous randomised controlled trials. NCT01313858.

324154	English Abstract	The agglomeration of leucocytes serves for the proof of activation of the leucocytic system, the so-called leucergia, which among other occurs in inflammatory diseases of different genesis. On the basis of 1,000 examinations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis the sensitivity of the method was tested compared with the usual criteria of inflammation. In agroup of patients with slight activity with the agglomeration of leucocytes an inflammatory activity could be proved in 67.5% (electrophoresis 53.5%, BSR 49.2%, CrP 35.4%, leucocytosis 27.9%). The chi2-test resulted in a significant correspondence between the examinations mentioned and the agglomeration (p less than 0.001). In contrast to the usual criteria of activity the proof of leucergy is a new principle ofthe diagnostics of activity. High sensitivity and simple methodics recommend the use of the agglomeration of leucocytes in routine diagnostics.

The aim of the present study was to examine the interleukin-6 (IL-6) -174 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA and its association with disease susceptibility and activity. The study included 98 patients with RA diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was used for analysis of the polymorphism at position -174 in the promoter of the IL-6 gene. The distribution of IL-6 genotypes in RA patients did not differ from that in control subjects. Nevertheless, in patients with a GG genotype the active form of RA was more frequently diagnosed compared with homozygous CC and GC patients. Moreover, in carriers of two G alleles the parameters of disease activity score (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), number of swollen and tender joints] were significantly increased. We suggest that the IL-6 promoter polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor for RA activity.

25270567	Journal Article	The advent of biologic therapy in the treatment of rheumatic diseases has intensified the need to further define and characterize spondyloarthritis (SpA). There has been a long debate over nomenclature of the SpA subtypes. There are those who are considered \&quot;lumpers,\&quot; favoring the notion that different entities of the SpA groups are manifestations of the same disease, and \&quot;splitters,\&quot; those who believe the different SpA groups represent separate diseases with shared clinical features. The influential work by Moll et al. has led to separation of entities and recognition of etiological processes of SpA subtypes. Among these subtypes has emerged nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), which is believed to be either an early form of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) or perhaps a different disease entity altogether. Recently attention has shifted to the characterization of early SpA, with special emphasis on nonradiographic axial SpA. The Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) has developed new criteria for the classification of this disease entity. Along with the advent of these criteria have come several unanswered questions. Although data suggests that nr-axSpA will evolve into AS over time, the natural evolution of disease is still undetermined since a proportion of cases do not progress. A number of questions also remain regarding features of patients with AS compared to those with nonradiographic disease. This appraisal highlights the differences in disease characteristics between men and women in regards to measures of disease activity, inflammatory markers, and radiologic findings. Recent studies also suggest fibromyalgia as a potential confounding factor in assessing disease activity and establishing a diagnosis of axSpA in the female population. Nonradiographic axial SpA is a relevant disease subgroup of axial SpA, and several questions have been left unanswered with more research needed regarding diagnosis (particularly in women), treatment, and long-term disease course.

21503617	Journal Article	The purpose of this study is to evaluate cardiovascular risk assessment at a Canadian rheumatology center and describe the cardiovascular risk of inflammatory arthritis (IA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients using the Framingham risk score. A retrospective chart review of 504 patients attending nine rheumatology practices at the University of Alberta Hospital was performed. A pre-specified case report form detailed patient demographics, cardiac risk factors, variables for the Framingham 2008 score, disease activity, and medication use. In this group of 504 patients, 64 (12.7%) had SLE (male (M) to female (F) ratio = 60:4) and 440 (87.3%) had an IA (M to F ratio = 117:323). Of the SLE patients, 31 (48.4%) met four or more American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, 33 (51.6%) had less than four ACR criteria. Of the IA patients, 156 (35.5%) were CCP positive and 257 (58.4%) were RF positive. Utilizing the chart data, retrospective Framingham risk scores were calculable for one (1.6%) SLE patient and three (0.68%) IA patients. The most common cardiac risk factors not documented in the medical records of both the SLE and IA patients included: (1) positive family history of MI, (2) diabetes, and (3) lipid status. The blood pressure was more frequently documented in the SLE patients (93.8%) compared to the IA patients (56.1%). While traditional cardiac risk factors only partially contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in these patients, cardiovascular risk assessment was suboptimally performed amongst a large group of rheumatologists. A dedicated cardiovascular risk reduction clinic for inflammatory rheumatic diseases has been established at this site to fulfill this need and evaluate treatment strategies.

19950299	Clinical Trial, Phase II	To assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the CC chemokine receptor CCR1 antagonist MLN3897 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving methotrexate (MTX). In this phase IIa, proof-of-concept study, patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA who had been taking MTX for &gt;or=6 months with evidence of active disease were randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg oral MLN3897 or matching placebo once daily for 12 weeks (days 1-83) while continuing to receive MTX once a week. Clinical assessments, safety monitoring, and sampling for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses were performed throughout the study. The primary efficacy end point was the difference in the percentage of patients meeting the ACR 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) on day 84 in the MLN3897-treated group compared with that in the placebo-treated group. MLN3897 was well tolerated, with no evidence of systemic immunosuppression. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference in day 84 ACR20 response rates between MLN3897-treated patients and placebo-treated patients (35% versus 33%, respectively; P=0.72). Results were similar for the per-protocol population. Pharmacokinetic analyses demonstrated no interactions between MLN3897 and MTX. MLN3897 was associated with a high degree of CCR1 occupancy (&gt;or=90% on days 28, 56, and 84 in 82% of patients, by macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha internalization assay). MLN3897 at a concentration of 10 mg once daily had no discernible activity in patients with RA who were also receiving MTX. The results suggest that CCR1 antagonism is unlikely to be a viable strategy for the treatment of RA when used in isolation at the receptor occupancy levels reached in this study.

27598995	Journal Article	Granzyme A (GzmA) levels are elevated in the plasma and synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suggesting involvement of this protease in the pathogenesis of the disease. GzmA contributes to sepsis by regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of GzmA to the pathogenesis of RA in vivo and to examine the possibility that GzmA acting via tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulates osteoclastogenesis. Inflammatory arthritis induced by type II collagen was evaluated in wild-type, GzmA-deficient, and perforin-deficient mice. The osteoclastogenic potential of GzmA was examined in vitro using bone marrow cells and colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) cells and in vivo using GzmA-deficient mice. Gene deletion of GzmA attenuated collagen-induced arthritis, including serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, joint damage, and bone erosion in affected mice, suggesting that osteoclast activity is reduced in the absence of GzmA. Accordingly, GzmA-treated bone marrow cells produced multinucleated cells that fulfilled the criteria for mature osteoclasts: tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, β integrin expression, calcitonin receptor expression, and resorptive activity on dentin slices. GzmA appeared to act without accessory cells, and its activity was not affected by osteoprotegerin, suggesting a minor contribution of RANKL. It also induced the expression and secretion of TNF. Neutralization of TNF or stimulation of CFU-GM cells from TNF&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice prevented GzmA-induced osteoclastogenesis. GzmA-deficient mice had reduced osteoclastogenesis in vivo (fewer calcitonin receptor-positive multinucleated cells and fewer transcripts for cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and TRAP in joints) and reduced serum levels of C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen. GzmA contributes to the joint destruction of RA partly by promoting osteoclast differentiation.

22416768	Journal Article	To evaluate the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vs. controls, and to verify possible associations of MetS with specific disease-related factors. The subjects were 283 RA patients and 226 healthy controls, frequency matched by age and sex. MetS was defined according to National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) criteria. Disease activity was evaluated with the Disease Activity Score using 28 joints (DAS28). A standardized clinical evaluation was performed and cardiovascular risk factors were assessed. The criteria for MetS were met by 39.2% RA patients vs. 19.5% in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Increased waist circumference, elevated blood pressure (BP), and fasting glucose were more frequent in RA patients than controls (p &lt; 0.001 for all associations). By multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted for age, sex, and years at school), the risk of having MetS was significantly higher for RA patients than for controls [odds ratio (OR) 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-3.00, p = 0.009]. The DAS28 was significantly higher in RA patients with MetS than in those without MetS (3.59 ± 1.27 vs. 3.14 ± 1.53; p = 0.01). Disease duration, the presence of rheumatoid factor, and extra-articular manifestations were similar for patients with and without MetS. MetS frequency was higher in RA patients than in controls. Among RA patients, MetS was associated with disease activity. The higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in RA suggests that inflammatory processes play a notable role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and indicates that tight control of systemic inflammatory activity and CVD modifiable risk factors should be recommended.

20597273	Clinical Trial	To estimate the prevalence and impact of lower extremity peripheral vein diseases on the course of articular syndrome in osteoarthrosis (OA), to reveal the specific features of concomitant pathology, and to substantiate the necessity of its therapeutic correction. One hundred and fifty-eight patients with the valid diagnosis of OA (by the American College of Pheumatology criteria) were followed up. Their mean age was 56.4 +/- 9.6 years. Lower extremity peripheral vein diseases were detected in 51.3% of the patients with OA, which permitted identification of 2 patient groups comparable for the major parameters. During the examination, the clinical parameters of articular syndrome were assessed at the start and 2 months after therapy. The higher intensity of the pain syndrome, lowered functional activity, and more common synovitis were observed in the patients with concomitant diseases of joints and veins as compared with those without signs of venous insufficiency. After therapeutic measures, joint pain, synovitis, and lower functional activity persisted in the patients with concomitant diseases. Reexamination showed that most patients with concomitant pathology needed analgesic therapy; in Group 2 without a history of vein diseases, the dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) could be halved in 21 (27.3%) patients; 37 (48.0%) patients were in no need of continuous use of NSAID. Impaired peripheral venous blood flow reduces the efficiency of therapy for OA, which makes it necessary to timely detect lower extremity varices and to perform goal-oriented therapy in such patients.

17989918	Journal Article	We evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture as a useful adjuvant treatment in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A pilot, randomized, double-blind, and controlled clinical trial was conducted. Forty RA patients with active disease despite stable therapy for at least the preceding 1 month were randomized to receive a standard protocol of acupuncture (AC) or superficial acupuncture at non-acupuncture points (controlAC) for 9 weeks. The primary outcome was achievement of 20% improvement according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 criteria after five and ten treatment sessions and after 1 month of follow-up. Secondary measures included Disease Assessment Scale (DAS), tender and swollen joint count, morning stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, physician global assessment of activity disease, physician and patient global assessment of treatment, and inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein). There was not significant difference between the groups regarding the number of patients that reached ACR20 at the end of the treatment (p=0.479). However, after 1 month of follow-up, there was a trend in favor of the AC group, with p=0.068. Compared with the controlAC, the AC group also demonstrated significant improvement in the patient and physician global assessment of treatment and physician global assessment of disease activity, but there was no difference on other clinical and laboratorial measures. On the other hand, only the AC patients had within group improvement on the variables DAS, HAQ, morning stiffness, patient and physician global assessment of treatment, and physician global assessment of disease activity in comparison to baseline visit. Despite the improvement of some studied variables, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients that reached ACR20 between the AC and controlAC groups. This negative result can be related to the small sample size, selection of patients, type of acupuncture protocol applied, and difficulties in establishing an innocuous and trustworthy placebo group to studies involving acupuncture.

15641055	Clinical Trial	To explore the impact of an early treatment response on maintenance of work capacity in patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In the Finnish Rheumatoid Arthritis Combination Therapy trial, 195 patients with recent-onset RA were randomized to receive either a combination of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) with prednisolone or a single DMARD with or without prednisolone for 2 years. Treatment responses were evaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. After a 5-year followup, the cumulative number of days of sick leave and RA-related permanent work disability was calculated for each of the 162 patients who were available for the active work force at baseline. Of the 159 patients assessed at 6 months, 29 were in clinical remission, 66 achieved an ACR50 response but not remission, 29 achieved an ACR20 response but not an ACR50 response, and 35 failed to achieve an ACR20 response. In these 4 groups, the median numbers of work disability days per patient-year from 6 months through 60 months of followup were 0 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-3), 4 (IQR 0-131), 16 (IQR 0-170), and 352 (16-365), respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Pairwise multiple comparisons showed a statistically significant difference between all groups except the ACR50 and ACR20 groups. At 12 months, 30 patients were in remission. None of the 44 patients in remission at 6 or 12 months became permanently work disabled over the 5-year followup, as compared with 15 patients in the ACR50 group (23%), 6 in the ACR20 group (21%), and 19 without an ACR20 response at 6 months (56%). Prompt induction of remission translates into maintenance of work capacity. At 6 months, an ACR50 response is no better than an ACR20 response with regard to future productivity, while failure to achieve an ACR20 response carries a high risk for work disability.

10589361	Clinical Trial	Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a major proinflammatory cytokine in the rheumatoid joint. TNF activity can be neutralized by administration of a recombinant version of its soluble p75 TNF receptor linked to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin IgG1 (etanercept). The present study examined the combination of etanercept with methotrexate (MTX) in a group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had persistent activity despite monotherapy with MTX. The etanercept-MTX group had a significantly better outcome than the placebo-MTX group using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. At 6 months, 71% of the patients in the etanercept-MTX group had an ACR 20% response (versus 27% in the placebo-MTX group). In the etanercept-MTX group, 39% had an ACR 50% response (versus 3% in the placebo-MTX group), and 15% in the etanercept-MTX group versus 0% in the placebo-MTX group met the robust ACR 70% response. The present study indicates that etanercept is a novel and robust drug in combination with MTX for the treatment of RA.

16353227	Evaluation Studies	To examine synovial vascularity and flow patterns in hand and wrist joints--metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and ulnar stiloid (USTL) regions--of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using power Doppler sonography (PDUS) and spectral Doppler analysis and to assess the accuracy of PDUS in detecting overall disease activity in RA patients. Two hundred forty MCP joints and 48 USTL regions in 24 RA patients were examined. Patients were categorized into 2 groups--active and inactive--according to the American College of Rheumatology remission criteria. Resistance indexes (RIs) were measured. Flow signals were detected in 50 MCP joints (in 13 patients) and 24 USTL regions (in 16 patients) and spectral analysis was performed in 46 MCP joints (12 patients) and 23 USTL regions (16 patients). The sensitivity and specificity of PDUS in detecting disease activity in RA were 92% and 40%, respectively. There was a negative correlation between flow signal number and RI, with higher scores of flow signals corresponding to lower RIs. PDUS appears to be a reliable method for assessing inflammatory activity in rheumatoid synovium.

14969061	Journal Article	The Austrian Early Arthritis Registry (Austrian Early Arthritis Action, EAA) enrols and follows patients with inflammatory arthritis of very short (&lt; 12 weeks) duration. Currently, data on 375 patients (almost 2000 individual follow-up examinations) have been entered into the EA database. Evaluations of data from 182 patients with a follow-up of at least one year are available. 65% of these patients have RA, as diagnosed using the ACR classification criteria in a cumulative fashion. Approximately 15% of these patients still have no established diagnosis and are being carried forward and observed as cases of \&quot;undifferentiated arthritis\&quot;. In RA patients, the mean DAS 28 decreased significantly from an initial mean score of 5.5 (high disease activity) into the range of low disease activity. At the end of one year a DAS 28 of &lt; 3.2 was observed in 52% of the RA patients. Radiological progression in these RA patients, who also received treatment very early, appears to be less severe than in other cohorts, although direct comparisons are impossible due to different methods of patient selection. In addition, the serological data from our cohort in cooperation with other study groups will allow development and validation of possible prediction algorithms for early arthritis patients which could improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this patient group.

22162258	Controlled Clinical Trial	The constituents of Nigella sativa modulate the immune system. The aim of the present work was to study the effectiveness of Nigella sativa oil in RA patients. Data from 40 female RA patients diagnosed according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR were analysed and discussed. The patients took two placebo (starch filled) capsules daily for 1 month. This was followed by a month of Nigella sativa oil capsules 500 mg twice/day. The disease activity score (DAS-28) significantly decreased after receiving the Nigella sativa capsules (4.55 ± 0.82) compared with before and after placebo (4.98 ± 0.79 and 4.99 ± 0.72, respectively) (p = 0.017). Similarly, the number of swollen joints and the duration of morning stiffness improved. A marked improvement in the disease activity was shown by both the ACR20 and EULAR response criteria in 42.5% and 30% of the patients, respectively, after intake of Nigella. Supplementation with Nigella sativa during DMARD therapy in RA may be considered an affordable potential adjuvant biological therapy.

27370881	Journal Article	To determine the level of residual inflammation [synovitis, bone marrow edema (BME), tenosynovitis, and total inflammation] quantified by hand magnetic resonance imaging (h-MRI) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in remission according to 3 different definitions of clinical remission, and to compare these remission definitions. A cross-sectional study. To assess the level of residual MRI inflammation in remission, cutoff levels associated to remission and median scores of MRI residual inflammatory lesions were calculated. Data from an MRI register of patients with RA who have various levels of disease activity were used. These were used for the analyses: synovitis, BME according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring system, tenosynovitis, total inflammation, and disease activity composite measures recorded at the time of MRI. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to identify the best cutoffs associated with remission for each inflammatory lesion on h-MRI. Median values of each inflammatory lesion for each definition of remission were also calculated. A total of 388 h-MRI sets of patients with RA with different levels of disease activity, 130 in remission, were included. Cutoff values associated with remission according to the Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) ≤ 3.3 and the Boolean American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) definitions for BME and tenosynovitis (1 and 3, respectively) were lower than BME and tenosynovitis (2 and 5, respectively) for the Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28) ≤ 2.6. Median scores for synovitis, BME, and total inflammation were also lower for the SDAI and Boolean ACR/EULAR remission criteria compared with DAS28. Patients with RA in remission according to the SDAI and Boolean ACR/EULAR definitions showed lower levels of MRI-detected residual inflammation compared with DAS28.

26784398	Journal Article	To investigate the frequency of remaining pain in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after 3 months of treatment with methotrexate as the only disease modifying antirheumatic drug, with a special focus on patients with a good clinical response. The study base was cases reported to a population-based early RA cohort who had followup data from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register (n = 1,241). The Disease Activity Score in 28 joints European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria were used to evaluate clinical response to treatment as good, moderate, and no response. The primary end point was remaining pain at the 3-months followup visit, defined as pain &gt;20 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Remaining pain in spite of a EULAR good response at followup was associated with higher baseline disability, using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4-3.4] per unit increase), and less baseline inflammation, using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (adjusted OR 0.81 [95% CI 0.70-0.93] per 10-mm increase). Similar associations were detected for remaining pain at followup in spite of low inflammatory activity, defined as a C-reactive protein level &lt;10. Increase in VAS pain during the treatment period was observed in 19% of the whole cohort, with frequencies in the EULAR response groups of 9% (good response), 15% (moderate response), and 45% (no response). These results are in line with the hypothesis that a subgroup of early RA patients exhibits pain that is not inflammatory mediated, where alternative treatment strategies to traditional antiinflammatory medications need to be considered.

15208174	Evaluation Studies	In clinical trials, at the group level, results are usually reported as mean and standard deviation of the change in score, which is not meaningful for most readers. To determine the minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) of pain, patient\&#39;s global assessment of disease activity, and functional impairment in patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA). A prospective multicentre 4 week cohort study involving 1362 outpatients with knee or hip OA was carried out. Data on assessment of pain and patient\&#39;s global assessment, measured on visual analogue scales, and functional impairment, measured on the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) function subscale, were collected at baseline and final visits. Patients assessed their response to treatment on a five point Likert scale at the final visit. An anchoring method based on the patient\&#39;s opinion was used. The MCII was estimated in a subgroup of 814 patients (603 with knee OA, 211 with hip OA). For knee and hip OA, MCII for absolute (and relative) changes were, respectively, (a) -19.9 mm (-40.8%) and -15.3 mm (-32.0%) for pain; (b) -18.3 mm (-39.0%) and -15.2 mm (-32.6%) for patient\&#39;s global assessment; (c) -9.1 (-26.0%) and -7.9 (-21.1%) for WOMAC function subscale score. The MCII is affected by the initial degree of severity of the symptoms but not by age, disease duration, or sex. Using criteria such as MCII in clinical trials would provide meaningful information which would help in interpreting the results by expressing them as a proportion of improved patients.

22035625	Journal Article	The goal of the present study is to systematically review the scientific literature addressing central sensitization and central nociceptive processing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To identify relevant articles, we searched PubMed and Web of Science. The search strategy was a combination of terms of the following groups: \&quot;Rheumatoid arthritis,\&quot; inflammatory joint pain, or arthritis; AND (central) sensitization, (central) hypersensitivity, central hyperexcitability, pain modulation, pain processing, neural inhibition, or pain physiopathology; AND pain, nociception, hyperalgesia, pain threshold, or algometry. Articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were screened for methodologic quality with specific checklists to evaluate different study designs (2 independent raters). Twenty-four full-text articles were included, of which the majority were case-control studies, followed by nonsystematic reviews, cross-sectional studies, and case reports. Methodologic quality was very heterogeneous. Preliminary evidence for generalized hyperalgesia in RA is available. In addition, the mechanism behind impaired central nociceptive processing remains rather obscure. The role of cytokines and neuropeptides especially remains to be elucidated. Windup appears to develop more easily in RA, but evidence in support of impaired nociceptive inhibition and cognitive emotional sensitization (sensitization due to cognitive bias) is scarce. The symmetrical manifestation of the disease, the poor relation between disease activity and symptoms, and the generalized hyperalgesia at both articular and nonarticular sites for different kinds of stimuli are indicative of the presence of central sensitization in RA patients. Further research is required to provide firm evidence in support of various aspects of central sensitization in humans with RA.

15540421	Clinical Trial	The study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of small-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) in combination with essential drugs used in early rheumatic arthritis (RA) on the clinical and laboratory activity and progression of joint destruction. Sixty-two patients aged 18-63 years who had active RA (its history being 1.5 to 24 months) and had not received basic therapy before were given methotrexate (MT) in a dose of 7.5-10.0 mg/week. Prednisolone (P) was randomly used in a dose equal or more than 10 mg/day). The efficiency of treatment was evaluated every 3 months by the ACR criteria 20/50/70. X-ray study of the hand and foot joints (the Larsen procedure by erosion calculations) was performed and the serum levels of C-reactive protein (C-RP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured before and 12 months after therapy. In the MT group, the patients\&#39; mean age was 52.0 +/- 10.5 years, the history of RA was 8.4 +/- 6.8 months; 82% of the patients were seropositive in terms of rheumatoid factor; the DAS 28 index was 5.2 +/- 0.8; in the P+MT group, the above parameters were 51.9 +/- 11. 7 years, 9.1 +/- 6.0 months, 83%, and 5.4 +/- 0.8, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). Throughout one-year follow-up, the patients whose parameters corresponded to ACR 70 were more in the P+MT group than in the MT group (p &lt; 0.05). The level of IL-6 and C-RP significantly decreased only in the P+MT group. There was a significant in the Larsen scores in both groups. A much fewer number of new erosions was revealed in the P+MT group than that in the MT group. According to the ACR 70 criteria, the efficiency of treatment with small-dose GCs was much higher than that in MT monotherapy. The small doses of GCs significantly lowered the laboratory activity of RA (C-RP, IL-6) and the occurrence of erosions.

3006976	Comparative Study	It is suggested by many tests that phagocytic cells were implied in inflammation which occurred during rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Further, three subject populations were selected for this study: Rheumatoid arthritis patients diagnosed according to American Rheumatism Association criteria (ARA mean = 6) and treated with gold compounds. Control subjects treated with the same non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac (75 mg per day). Normal subjects without disease or treatment. Blood granulocytes and monocytes were separately tested for ingestion of three different particle species (opsonized zymosan, immunoglobulin G sheep red cells, glutaraldehyde-treated sheep red cells) and stimulation of superoxide anion production by these particles. All phagocytic cells in RA patients have normal phagocytic response and superoxide anion production. Autologous serum does not inhibit the activity of these cells. In addition the NSAID (diclofenac) does not act upon phagocytosis and oxidative burst of control cells.

9251634	Clinical Trial	The value of intensive combination therapy in early rheumatoid arthritis is unproven. In a multicentre, double-blind, randomised trial (COBRA), we compared the combination of sulphasalazine (2 g/day), methotrexate (7.5 mg/week), and prednisolone (initially 60 mg/day, tapered in 6 weekly steps to 7.5 mg/day) with sulphasalazine alone. 155 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (median duration 4 months) were randomly assigned combined treatment (76) or sulphasalazine alone (79). Prednisolone and methotrexate were tapered and stopped after 28 and 40 weeks, respectively. The main outcomes were the pooled index (a weighted change score of five disease activity measures) and the Sharp/Van der Heijde radiographic damage score in hands and feet. Independent health-care professionals assessed the main outcomes without knowledge of treatment allocation. At week 28, the mean pooled index was 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.6) in the combined treatment group and 0.8 (0.6-1.0) in the sulphasalazine group (p &lt; 0.0001). At this time, 55 (72%) and 39 (49%) patients, respectively, were improved according to American College of Rheumatology criteria. The clinical difference between the groups decreased and was no longer significant after prednisolone was stopped, and there were no further changes after methotrexate was stopped. At 28 weeks, the radiographic damage score had increased by a median of 1 (range 0-28) in the combined-therapy group and 4 (0-44) in the sulphasalazine group (p &lt; 0.0001). The increases at week 56 (2 [0-43] vs 6 [0-54], p = 0.004), and at week 80 (4 [0-80] vs 12 [0-72], p = 0.01) were also significant. Further analysis suggests that combined therapy immediately suppressed damage progression, whereas sulphasalazine did so less effectively and with a lag of 6 to 12 months. There were fewer withdrawals in the combined therapy than the sulphasalazine group (6 [8%] vs 23 [29%]), and they occurred later. This combined-therapy regimen offers additional disease control over and above that of sulphasalazine alone that persists for up to a year after corticosteroids are stopped. Although confirmatory studies and long-term follow-up are needed, this approach may prove useful in the treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis.

20067641	Journal Article	Lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB) probiotics demonstrate immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects and the ability to lessen the symptoms of arthritis in both animals and humans. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design, clinical pilot trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of the LAB probiotic preparation, Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086, on symptoms and measures of functional capacity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with pharmacological anti-arthritic medications. Forty-five adult men and women with symptoms of RA were randomly assigned to receive Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 or placebo once a day in a double-blind fashion for 60 days in addition to their standard anti-arthritic medications. Arthritis activity was evaluated by clinical examination, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and laboratory tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Subjects who received Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 experienced borderline statistically significant improvement in the Patient Pain Assessment score (P = .052) and statistically significant improvement in Pain Scale (P = .046) vs placebo. Compared with placebo, Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 treatment resulted in greater improvement in patient global assessment and self-assessed disability; reduction in CRP; as well as the ability to walk 2 miles, reach, and participate in daily activities. There were no treatment-related adverse events reported throughout this study. Results of this pilot study suggest that adjunctive treatment with Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 LAB probiotic appeared to be a safe and effective for patients suffering from RA. Because of the low study population size, larger trials are needed to verify these results. ACTRN12609000435280.

21945385	Journal Article	Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is designed for patients presenting arthritic wear limited to a single medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartment. The indication is based on strict criteria. Wear must stem from degenerative osteoarthritis or be secondary to aseptic necrosis of the medial condyle. Inflammatory rheumatism is a contraindication. Age and activity level should be compatible with an indication for arthroplasty. The body mass index should be less than 30 kg/m(2). The ligament system must be intact, particularly both cruciate ligaments. Any pre-existing axis deformity should be moderate and the residual axis deformity, after correction of wear with a unicompartmental tibial augmentation spacer, should not exceed 7-10° varus or valgus. These highly restrictive conditions result in the ideal indications for UKA suitable for no more than 15-20% of knee arthroplasty candidates for most surgeons experienced in this procedure. Although the results of certain early series worried potential users, today it can be asserted that recent series whose indications and technique correspond to modern use criteria, have shown results that are as reliable as those of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at a 10 years\&#39; follow-up. Beyond this time frame, the risk of polyethylene wear related to the technical restrictions of the UKA is another consideration. Indeed, to prevent the risk of rapid extension of osteoarthritis to the opposite compartment, the procedure should be limited to restoring the patient\&#39;s constitutional axis before wear phenomena had set in. This makes UKA a surgical procedure at risk of failure due to wear phenomena. Much of this paper will describe the precise rules for UKA positioning, which are critical to observe to warrant these implants outcome and longevity.

1218371	Journal Article	A survey of 118 patients seen in the last twenty years in Newcastle upon Tyne forms the basis of this report. All of these 118 patients fulfilled clearly defined clinical, electrophysiological and pathological criteria for the diagnosis of polymyositis: muscle pain, weakness and characteristic EMG and/or muscle biopsy 55%; and characteristic muscle biopsy 17%; muscle weakness and characteristic EMG 7%; muscle weakness and pain, and raised serum CK activity in an established collagen-vascular disease 5%. A smaller group of 25 patients were selected in whom the clinical characteristics, EMG, muscle biopsy and serum enzyme levels were all completely diagnostic of polymyositis. The patients were followed for two months to twenty-six years, with a mean follow-up duration of six years. Analysis was made of the features at presentation and during the course of the illness, and of prognostic factors bearing upon the disability, response to treatment and mortality. Cases were classified according to the system of Rose and Walton (1966). Groups I, II, and III each constituted approximately one-third of the total cases, while only 8% of all cases were associated with carcinoma. The female to male ratio was 1.4:1. Though cases were seen in all age groups, the largest number was in the sixth decade. The sedimentation rate was raised in 55% of cases. Electromyography was characteristic of polymyositis in 45% of cases, and in only 11% was it normal. The serum creatine kinase activity was raised in 64% of cases. There was no correlation between the extent of these abnormalities and the degree of weakness or disability. 65% of muscle biopsies had changes with inflammatory infiltration virtually diagnostic of polymyositis. 17% of cases had a normal muscle biopsy. Most of the patients (89%) were treated with high-dose prednisone therapy, commencing with 30-100 mg/day, gradually reducing to a maintenance dose of 5-15 mg/day over two or three months. All clinical groups showed considerable improvement in average disability with time on \&quot;high dose\&quot; corticosteroid therapy, the maximum improvement occurring within the first three years. The degree of improvement in disability was considerably less in those inadequately treated, though the mortality rate was similar in the two groups. 66% of all survivors had essentially no functional disability at follow-up three or more years later, and in the majority of these cases the disease appeared to have burned itself out. 33% of cases had significant disability after three years, and in half of these the disease appeared to be still active.

10685819	Journal Article	To investigate the relationships between systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis disease activity, course of the disease, and functional class according to Steinbrocker. The records of all children with systemic onset juvenile arthritis (JA) according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria attending our center since 1971 with a minimum followup period of 3 years were reviewed. A cohort of 80 consecutive patients entered the study: 42 males, 38 females, mean age at onset 6.3 years (range 0.7-16), mean followup period 10.7 years (range 3-33). The cumulative duration of the active periods (CDAP) in months was calculated for every patient. Three patterns of disease course were apparent: monocyclic (subtype I), intermittent (subtype II), and persistent (subtype III). At the last control the functional class and disease activity status were evaluated. In all subtype I patients (9 cases) the disease was in remission and no patient was in class II, III, or IV. In subtype II patients (27 cases), 16 were inactive or in remission and 6 in class III. In subtype III (44 cases) 21 were inactive or in remission and 17 were in class III or IV. The equation relating the Steinbrocker class to the CDAP was calculated considering the functional outcome as the dependent variable. The linear regression equation y = 0.0083 x + 1.266 was found with a correlation coefficient r = 0.586 (p &lt; 0.0001). The majority of our patients were treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, which in many cases were effective in reducing the duration of the active phases of disease. Systemic onset JA may present with different clinical courses; the functional outcome is always good in subtype I (monocyclic), but can be poor in subtypes II and III. The severity of disability evaluated according to Steinbrocker classes is dependent on the cumulative duration of the active periods of the disease.

We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study of 55 patients with RA, who were subjected to clinical evaluation and MRI assessment. Imaging of the clinically dominant foot was performed, and both the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28-CRP) and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were measured. The majority of patients classified as in clinical remission presented some degree of inflammatory activity upon MRI evaluation. Statistical analysis demonstrated no correlation between MRI findings and clinical scores. There is evidence of disease activity on MRI of the clinically dominant foot even in patients classified as in clinical remission according to the DAS28-CRP criteria.

19644846	Journal Article	Remission has become an attainable goal of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, especially since the advent of biologic antirheumatic therapy. Because little is known about patients who achieve disease remission with conventional treatment, we used 2 large independent inception cohorts to study the prevalence of and predictive factors for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-free sustained remission after treatment with conventional therapy. Remission of disease was assessed in 454 patients from the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (EAC) and in 895 patients from the British Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study (ERAS) who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology 1987 revised criteria for the classification of RA and were treated with conventional therapy. Sustained DMARD-free remission was defined as fulfilling the following criteria for at least 1 year: 1) no current DMARD use, 2) no swollen joints, and 3) classification as DMARD-free remission by the patient\&#39;s rheumatologist. Predictive factors were identified by Cox regression analysis. Sustained DMARD-free remission was achieved by 68 of 454 patients (15.0%) in the Leiden EAC and by 84 of 895 patients (9.4%) in the ERAS. Six factors were associated with sustained DMARD-free remission in both cohorts: acute onset, short symptom duration before inclusion, not smoking, little radiographic damage at baseline, absence of IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), and absence of HLA shared epitope alleles. In the ERAS, low disease activity at baseline was also predictive of remission. Multivariate analyses revealed symptom duration and the absence of autoantibodies (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 2 and IgM-RF) as independent predictors. Sustained DMARD-free remission in RA patients treated with conventional therapy is not uncommon. Symptom duration at presentation and the absence of autoantibodies are associated with sustained DMARD-free remission.

24299607	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease, affects approximately 1 in 100 individuals. Effective treatment for RA is not yet available because current research does not have a clear understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of RA. Xinfeng Capsule, a patent Chinese herbal medicine, has been used in the treatment of RA in recent years. Despite its reported clinical efficacy, there are no large-sample, multicenter, randomized trials that support the use of Xinfeng Capsule for RA. Therefore, we designed a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of Xinfeng Capsule in the treatment of RA. This is a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial on the treatment of RA. The participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group at a ratio of 1:1. Participants in the experimental group will receive Xinfeng Capsule and a pharmaceutical placebo (imitation leflunomide). The control group will receive leflunomide and an herbal placebo (imitation Xinfeng Capsule). The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for RA will be used to measure the efficacy of the Xinfeng Capsule. The primary outcome measure will be the percentage of study participants who achieve an ACR 20% response rate (ACR20), which will be measured every 4 weeks after randomization. Secondary outcomes will include the ACR50 and ACR70 responses, the side effects of the medications, the Disease Activity Score 28, RA biomarkers, quality of life, and X-rays of the hands and wrists. The first four of the secondary outcomes will be measured every 4 weeks and the others will be measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The result of this trial will help to evaluate whether Xinfeng Capsule is effective and safe in the treatment of RA. This trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The identifier is NCT01774877.

10229394	Comparative Study	To evaluate whether the number of susceptible factors influences disease progression in Japanese patients diagnosed with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty-eight Japanese outpatients (46 female, 12 male; mean age 48.9 yrs) with early RA of less than one year after onset were enrolled in the study. The criteria for early RA (Japanese Ministry of Welfare) were used. DNA was extracted from fingernail clippings and the gene frequencies of HLA-DRB1 alleles were investigated. The degrees of progression of (1) clinical symptoms, (2) laboratory findings, (3) radiographic changes, and (4) magnetic resonance imaging score were analyzed by a comparison of the above at time of diagnosis and at final examination (an average of 14 months after the time of diagnosis). The frequencies of the susceptible factors (S: 0101, 0401, 0404, 0405, 1001, and 1402) were 17, 3.4, 0.9, 29, 0, and 0%, respectively. The progression of inflammatory autoimmune activity, erosion incidence, and synovial proliferation severity in the S/S group was significantly more rapid than that in the other groups. In the disease activity at each time, the difference between the S/S group and the S/N group was significant, as was that between the S/S group and the N/N group, but the difference between the S/N group and the N/N group was not significant. Haplotyping of HLA-DRB1 using the patient\&#39;s nail clippings may be useful as a prognostic marker for disease progression in early RA.

27716427	Journal Article	Toll-like receptor (TLR) family members are key players in inflammation. TLR10 has been poorly studied in chronic inflammatory disorders, and its clinical relevance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is as yet unknown. We aimed at identifying TLR10 variants within all coding regions of the gene in patients with RA as well as studying their functional and clinical significance. TLR10 gene variants were studied by performing sequencing of 66 patients with RA and 30 control subjects. A selected variant, I473T, was then analyzed in 1654 patients and 1702 healthy control subjects. The capacity of this TLR10 variant to modify the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) was determined by using a luciferase reporter assay and analyzing the expression of NFkB target genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Differences between groups were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test and the unpaired two-tailed Student\&#39;s t test. We detected ten missense variants in the TLR10 gene and focused on the I473T substitution based on allele frequencies and the predicted functional impact. I473T variant is not associated with susceptibility to RA, but it significantly correlates with erosive disease in patients seropositive for antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (p = 0.017 in the total cohort and p = 0.0049 in female patients) and with a lower response to infliximab treatment as measured by the change in Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (p = 0.012) and by the European League Against Rheumatism criteria (p = 0.049). Functional studies showed that TLR10 reduced activation of the NFkB inflammatory pathway in hematopoietic cells, whereas the I473T variant lacked this inhibitory capacity. Consistently, after exposure to infliximab, cells expressing the I437T variant showed higher NFkB activity than cells carrying wild-type TLR10. A TLR10 allelic variant, I473T, has impaired NFkB inhibitory activity and is highly associated with disease severity and low response to infliximab in patients with RA.

10890256	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease affecting 0.8% of the population. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the pain and inflammation of RA and improve mobility but do not slow the progression of joint damage. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which limit potentially irreversible joint damage, may influence the course of disease progression. This review describes the recently approved DMARD leflunomide, an isoxazole-based immunomodulator. Unlike other DMARDs, leflunomide arrests the growth of activated lymphocytes by inhibiting the enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a critical link in the production of uridine monophosphate. Leflunomide is rapidly metabolized to the active major metabolite A77 1726, which is responsible for the drug\&#39;s pharmacologic activity. Leflunomide has exerted inhibitory activity in animal models of RA. Its clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of controlled trials. In two multinational 52-week studies and two 24-week studies, all leflunomide-treated patients received an initial loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days, followed by 20 mg/d. The effects on the signs and symptoms of RA were evaluated using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 responder index, tender and swollen joint counts and scores, patients\&#39; and physician\&#39;s global assessments, and pain intensity index. Erosions and joint-space narrowing were assessed by radiography. Compared with placebo, leflunomide significantly improved the signs and symptoms of RA (41%-64% improvement) by ACR 20 responder criteria (P &lt; 0.001). Leflunomide, methotrexate, and sulfasalazine were equally effective in terms of symptom outcomes. In terms of retarding the progression of disease, leflunomide was significantly superior to placebo, with no consistent difference from methotrexate or sulfasalazine. In a trial using a combination of leflunomide and methotrexate therapy, 53% of patients were responders by ACR 20 criteria. Adverse effects in RA patients receiving leflunomide included diarrhea, elevated liver enzymes, alopecia, and rash. Additional adverse events occurring with a frequency &gt;5% included allergic reaction, asthenia, abdominal pain, back pain, and hypertension, among others. Thus leflunomide may be used in selected RA patients (ie, those starting RA therapy for the first time or failing earlier DMARD therapy). However, the product labeling requires monthly monitoring of liver enzymes until stable concentrations are reached. Other labeled warnings include a risk of immunosuppression and an increased risk of fetal death or teratogenic effects in pregnant women. Methotrexate, which is also hepatotoxic, is usually the initial DMARD recommended for use in patients with aggressive RA.

21996532	Comparative Study	To investigate the associations between perceived physical function (self-report) and physical and cognitive performance (objective assessments) in persons with fibromyalgia (FM). Correlational study. Exercise testing laboratory in Southern California. Community-residing ambulatory adults meeting the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for FM (N=68; mean age, 59.5y). Not applicable. Composite Physical Function scale, Senior Fitness Test (3 items), Fullerton Advanced Balance scale, 30-foot walk, Trail Making Test parts A and B, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, a composite score of these 3 cognitive measures, attention/executive function composite, processing speed composite, problem solving, inhibition, and episodic memory composite. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that after controlling for age and FM symptoms, better physical performance (based on assessments, not self-report) was associated with higher cognitive function in attention/executive function, processing speed, problem solving, and inhibition. Researchers should continue to investigate the relationship between physical and cognitive function in both clinical and nonclinical populations, as well as explore changes across time. Because physical activity has been associated with neural improvements, further research may identify whether particular mechanisms, such as neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, or changes in inflammatory marker levels, are involved.

2491400	English Abstract	In 65 patients with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis (RA), according to ARA criteria, and the active disease, we studied the correlation of the clinical status (the number of the swollen and tender joints) with the following laboratory parameters: sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum iron level, haemoglobin content and the number of erythrocytes, leucocytes and thrombocytes in the peripheral blood. All patients received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; 25,5% of them were on small daily doses of corticosteroids, and most of them (76,5%) were receiving some of the second-line drugs. The acceleration of the sedimentation rate was the most useful laboratory parameter and was found in 96,9% of the patients, followed by an increased quantity of the alpha-2 globulin, sideropenia and a decreased level of haemoglobin. Increase in the CRP titer was found in this study to be of a rather modest value and was increased in only 40% of the RA patients.

25581612	Journal Article	To evaluate the effect of sustained American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Boolean remission on residual joint inflammation assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to secondarily evaluate other clinical definitions of remission, within an early seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) cohort. A subcohort of 118 RA patients was enrolled from patients who completed the 2-year, double-blind randomized Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) trial. Patients received a single contrast-enhanced 1.5T MRI of their most involved wrist. Two readers scored MRIs for synovitis, osteitis, tenosynovitis, and erosions. Clinical assessments were performed every 3 months during the trial and at time of MRI. The subcohort was 92% seropositive with mean age 51 years, duration 4.1 months, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 5.8 at TEAR entry. Total MRI inflammatory scores (tenosynovitis + synovitis + osteitis) were lower among patients in clinical remission. Lower MRI scores were correlated with longer duration of Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) remission (ρ = 0.22, P = 0.03). At the time of MRI, 89 patients had no wrist pain/tenderness/swelling; however, all 118 patients had MRI evidence of residual joint inflammation after 2 years. No statistically significant differences in damage or MRI inflammatory scores were observed across treatment groups. This is the first detailed appraisal describing the relationship between clinical remission cut points and MRI inflammatory scores within an RA randomized controlled trial. The most stringent remission criteria (2011 ACR/EULAR and CDAI) best differentiate the total MRI inflammatory scores. These results document that 2 years of triple therapy or tumor necrosis factor plus methotrexate treatment in early RA does not eliminate MRI evidence of joint inflammation.

15151525	Journal Article	We prospectively studied the efficacy, incidence of adverse drug reactions and withdrawal from leflunomide in an outpatient population with rheumatoid arthritis in a setting of care-as-usual. In this prospective case series study, from outpatient medical records a standard dataset was collected including patient and disease characteristics, data on leflunomide use and adverse drug reactions. During the study period 136 rheumatoid arthritis patients started leflunomide. Median (range) follow-up duration was 317 (11-911) days. Sixty-five percent of patients experienced at least one adverse drug reaction related to leflunomide. During follow-up 76 patients (56%) withdrew from leflunomide treatment, mainly because of adverse drug reactions (29%) or lack of efficacy (13%). The overall incidence density for withdrawal from leflunomide was 56.2 per 100 patient-years. Complete data for calculating efficacy using a validated disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS(28)) was available for 48, 36, and 35% of patients at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up, respectively. Within a 12-month period after start of leflunomide treatment 76% of the evaluable patients were classified as moderate or good responders according to the DAS(28) response criteria. In the setting of care-as-usual, rheumatoid arthritis patients starting leflunomide frequently experienced adverse drug reactions. More than half of the patients withdrew from leflunomide treatment within a year after start of leflunomide treatment, mainly because of adverse drug reactions.

1471438	Journal Article	The aim of the study was the evaluation of a potential selection process for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) referred to the Mobile Service for Rheumatics in Hannover (MSRH). The MSRH is the only referral center for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases in Hannover. A comparison of the health status was made between 58 individuals with RA identified in a population study, and 103 RA patients from the MSRH. The following disease parameters were less favorable in the clinical group: duration of morning stiffness, functional capacity, number of swollen joints, rheumatoid factor, ESR, disease activity, and classical RA according to the Rome-criteria. Only 22% of the individuals with RA identified in the population study have been referred to the MSRH. These patients more frequently had definite or classical RA (statistically not significant: p = 0.17, p = 0.11, respectively). It was shown that the clinical group comprised more severe RA cases. Thus, data from such patients may not be generalized for the entire group of RA cases in the population.

20463187	Journal Article	The objective of this study was to examine 5-year change in cortical hand BMD in female RA patients with established disease. Further, possibly baseline predictors of 5-year loss in digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR)-BMD were studied. This 5-year multicentre, longitudinal study included patients from Amsterdam (the Netherlands), Truro (UK) and Oslo (Norway). At baseline, 50 patients were consecutively included per centre. Inclusion criteria were: female sex, age 50-70 years and disease duration &gt;or=5 years. This study presents 5-year follow-up data for 85 of these 150 patients (29 patients from Amsterdam; 26 from Truro; and 30 from Oslo). Clinical examination, blood test and radiographs were taken at baseline and 5-year follow-up. Cortical hand BMD was measured by DXR from hand radiographs. The mean (95% CI) baseline DXR-BMD for all patients was 0.46 (0.44, 0.48) g/cm(2) and the median 5-year DXR-BMD change was -6.7% (-11.2, -2.82%). Five-year DXR-BMD loss was associated with baseline measurements of age, RF, CRP, HAQ and 28-joint disease activity score (DAS-28) in univariate linear regression analyses. DAS-28 at baseline was an independent predictor of 5-year DXR-BMD loss in multivariate linear regression analyses corrected for centre, age and use of bone-protective agents. High disease activity measured by DAS-28 was an independent predictor of cortical hand bone loss over 5 years in established, destructive RA. This finding supports that increased disease activity leads to localized bone loss in long-standing RA and underlines the importance of tight control and aggressive anti-inflammatory treatment in these patients.

17394219	Evaluation Studies	To evaluate associations linking glucocorticoid dose changes in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) to the PMR activity score (PMR-AS) and its components. Nine clinical vignettes of PMR were written by a panel of experts and submitted to 35 rheumatologists, who were asked to assess disease activity using a visual analog scale (VASph) and to determine whether there was a relapse of PMR requiring an increase in the glucocorticoid dose. In 7 vignettes, &gt;80% of the rheumatologists agreed on the diagnosis of relapse justifying the glucocorticoid dose decision. A total of 243 vignette-physician combinations were obtained. Using these vignettes, we evaluated statistical associations linking a decision to increase the glucocorticoid dose to the value of PMR-AS, of its components (VASph, visual analog scale for pain [VASp], C-reactive protein level [CRP], morning stiffness [MST], and elevation of upper limbs [EUL]), or to the difference in these variables between the last 2 visits (dPMR-AS, dVASph, dVASp, dCRP, dMST, and dEUL). The strongest associations with a decision to increase the glucocorticoid dose occurred with dPMR-AS &gt;4.2, dMST &gt;10 minutes, dVASph &gt;1.55, and dCRP &gt;4 mg/dl (99.3% sensitivity, 100% specificity for all 4 variables); MST &gt;or=10 minutes (100% sensitivity, 99.3% specificity); PMR-AS &gt;or=7 (98.1% sensitivity, 94.3% specificity); VASph &gt;or=2.25 (94.2% sensitivity, 83.6% specificity); and CRP level &gt;or=14.5 mg/liter (66.3% sensitivity, 99.3% specificity). Despite inter-individual variations in VASph, PMR-AS was a good indicator of disease activity. However, MST, dMST, dVASph, dPMR-AS, and dCRP performed better than PMR-AS. These variables may be useful in tailoring the glucocorticoid dose to the individual needs of each patient.

28343623	Journal Article	Juvenile rheumatic diseases affect the musculoskeletal system and begin before the age of 18. These conditions have varied, identifiable or unknown etiologies, but those of an autoimmune inflammatory nature have been associated with an increased risk of development of cancer, regardless of treatment. This study aims to assess, through a systematic review of the literature according to Prisma (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) quality criteria, the risk of cancer in patients with juvenile rheumatic disease, and its association with biological agents. The criteria described by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology initiative were used in order to assess the methodological quality of those individual items selected in this study. We analyzed nine publications, from a total of 251 papers initially selected. There was an increase in cancer risk in the population with juvenile rheumatic disease versus the general population. Most specified cancers were of a lymphoproliferative nature. Seven studies did not specify the treatment or not defined an association between treatment and cancer risk. Only one study has suggested this association; in it, their authors observed high risk in patients diagnosed in the last 20 years, a period of the advent of new therapies. One study found an increased risk in a population not treated with biological agents, suggesting a disease in its natural course, and not an adverse effect of therapy. Studies have shown an increased risk of malignancy associated with juvenile rheumatic disease, and this may be related to disease activity and not specifically to the treatment with biological agents.

27502582	Journal Article	Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) is a common component of treatment regimens for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Etoricoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID that has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of RA at a dose of 90 mg. The current study further evaluated the efficacy of etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg in RA patients with active disease. This was a 2-part, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in RA (NCT01208181). Patients were required to have a diagnosis of RA (according to ARA 1987 revised classification criteria) and were to demonstrate symptom flare upon discontinuation of previous NSAID treatment prior to randomization. Part I was a 6-week, placebo-controlled period to assess the efficacy of etoricoxib 90 mg and etoricoxib 60 mg, each compared to placebo, as well as to each other. Part II was a 6-week period to evaluate the potential benefit of dose escalation from etoricoxib 60 mg to etoricoxib 90 mg after 6 weeks exposure to etoricoxib 60 mg in Part I compared to maintaining a steady dose of etoricoxib 60 mg throughout Parts I and II. Primary endpoints were Disease Activity Score evaluating 28 joints and C reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP) index and Patient Global Assessment of Pain (Pain) score (0-100 mm VAS) after 6 weeks of treatment in Part I. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. In total, 1404 patients were randomized in a 2:7:7:8 ratio; 1228 patients completed Part I and 713 patients continued to Part II. Both etoricoxib doses were superior to placebo on both primary efficacy endpoints (p = 0.004 for 60 mg and p = 0.034 for 90 mg for DAS28-CRP; p &lt; 0.001 for both doses for PGAP) in Part I. Further in Part I, etoricoxib 90 mg was not significantly different from 60 mg for DAS28-CRP, but did demonstrate a small, but statistically significant decrease in baseline PGAP score vs. 60 mg (p = 0.019). In Part II, there was no significant decrease in PGAP score after increasing to 90 mg in subjects with inadequate pain relief on 60 mg as compared to subjects who stayed on 60 mg. The incidence of AEs and SAEs were similar between etoricoxib 60 mg and 90 mg in both Part I and II. Both etoricoxib 90 mg and 60 mg are superior to placebo in relieving the symptoms of RA. Etoricoxib 90 mg vs 60 mg resulted in a statistically significant, though small, improvement in PGAP score, but not DAS28-CRP. Dose escalation from 60 mg to 90 mg in pain inadequate responders did not significantly improve efficacy. These results confirm the efficacy and tolerability of etoricoxib 90mg in patients with RA. In addition, this study demonstrated that etoricoxib 60 mg is also efficacious and well-tolerated in RA. NCT01208181 (registered September 22, 2010).

27549132	Journal Article	Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapies are able to control rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity and limit structural damage. Yet no predictive factor of response to anti-TNF has been identified. Metabolomic profile is known to vary in response to different inflammatory rheumatisms so determining it could substantially improve diagnosis and, consequently, prognosis. The aim of this study was to use mass spectrometry to determine whether there is variation in the metabolome in patients treated with anti-TNF and whether any particular metabolomic profile can serve as a predictor of therapeutic response. Blood samples were analyzed in 140 patients with active RA before initiation of anti-TNF treatment and after 6 months of Anti-TNF treatment (100 good responders and 40 non-responders). Plasma was deproteinized, extracted and analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography-QToF mass spectrometry. Extracted and normalized ions were tested by univariate and ANOVA analysis followed by partial least-squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) was also used to filter data from unwanted non-related effects. Disease activity scores (DAS 28) obtained at 6 months were correlated with metabolome variation findings to identify a metabolite that is predictive of therapeutic response to anti-TNF. After 6 months of anti-TNF therapy, 100 patients rated as good responders and 40 patients as non-responders according to EULAR criteria. Metabolomic investigations suggested two different metabolic fingerprints splitting the good-responders group and the non-responders group, without differences in anti-TNF therapies. Univariate analysis revealed 24 significant ions in positive mode (p &lt; 0.05) and 31 significant ions in negative mode (p &lt; 0.05). Once intersected with PLS results, only 35 ions remained. Carbohydrate derivates emerged as strong candidate determinants of therapeutic response. This is the first study describing metabolic profiling in response to anti-TNF treatments using plasma samples. The study highlighted two different metabolic profiles splitting good responders from non-responders.

24673738	Journal Article	The present study aimed at investigating the effects of Lactobacillus casei 01 supplementation on symptoms and inflammatory biomarkers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in women. In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, female patients with established RA for more than 1 year, 20-80 years of age and body mass index (BMI) lower than 40, who followed stable medication for 3 months prior to the supplementation, were randomly allocated to receive either one capsule containing 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) of L. casei 01, or a placebo for 8 weeks; allocation was stratified by BMI and menopausal status. Disease activity score-28 (DAS28) was calculated, European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response was evaluated and the cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were measured. Thirty patients were recruited in each group; 22 and 24 patients were analyzed in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively. L. casei 01 supplementation decreased serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, tender and swollen joint counts, global health (GH) score and DAS28 (P &lt; 0.05). More patients in the L. casei 01 group had moderate response to the treatment, based on the EULAR criteria, at the end of the study (P &lt; 0.01). At the end of the study, a significant difference was observed between the two groups for IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α changes through the study course (P &lt; 0.05), in favor of the probiotic group. No adverse effects were reported for the intervention. Probiotic supplementation may be an appropriate adjunct therapy for RA patients and help alleviate symptoms and improve inflammatory cytokines.

15033049	Clinical Trial	Knowing the efficacy of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antagonists infliximab or etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), when one of these agents has failed, has important clinical implications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etanercept in patients with RA, who had previously failed to infliximab. All patients with RA of our center, who were previously treated with infliximab and then switched to etanercept for at least 6 months were included. Several clinical and biological parameters of inflammatory activity along with the disease activity index DAS-28 were assessed at baseline, after 6 weeks, at the last infusion of infliximab and after 0, 3 and 6 months on etanercept. EULAR criteria of response to therapy were used. Fourteen RA patients (13 females) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected. These patients had been treated with infliximab for a mean (SD) of 14.6 (8.3) months when this drug was stopped. Drug withdrawal owed to inefficacy in 12 patients and to adverse events in 2 patients. Most patients achieved a satisfactory clinical response within the first months of infliximab, with a subsequent loss of the therapeutic effects in spite of an increase in the infliximab dose or a reduction of the interval between infusions. In the group of 12 patients switched to etanercept because of infliximab inefficacy, a therapeutic response was achieved in 10 (83%) of them after 6 months of etanercept therapy. The DAS-28 score (SD) improved from 5.6 (1) to 4.3 (0.8) (p = 0.019). An even better therapeutic response to etanercept was observed in those patients with an initial poor response to infliximab. No serious adverse effects were recorded during etanercept treatment. Etanercept is an efficient and safe therapy in RA patients when infliximab treatment has failed.

22562974	Journal Article	To assess the efficacy and safety of low-dose prednisone chronotherapy using a new modified-release (MR) formulation for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients with active RA (n=350) were randomised 2:1 to receive MR prednisone 5 mg or placebo once daily in the evening in addition to their existing RA disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving a 20% improvement in RA signs and symptoms according to American College of Rheumatology criteria (ie, an ACR20 response) at week 12. Changes in morning pain, duration of morning stiffness, 28-joint Disease Activity Score and health-related quality of life were also assessed. MR prednisone plus DMARD treatment produced higher response rates for ACR20 (48% vs 29%, p&lt;0.001) and ACR50 (22% vs 10%, p&lt;0.006) and a greater median relative reduction from baseline in morning stiffness (55% vs 35%, p&lt;0.002) at week 12 than placebo plus DMARD treatment. Significantly greater reductions in severity of RA (Disease Activity Score 28) (p&lt;0.001) and fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score) (p=0.003) as well as a greater improvement in physical function (36-item Short-Form Health Survey score) (p&lt;0.001) were seen at week 12 for MR prednisone versus placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar for MR prednisone (43%) and placebo (49%). Low-dose MR prednisone added to existing DMARD treatment produced rapid and relevant improvements in RA signs and symptoms.   CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, NUMBER:  NCT00650078.

28544615	Journal Article	In current management paradigms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), patient global assessment (PGA) is crucial to decide whether a patient has attained remission (target) or needs reinforced therapy. We investigated whether the clinical and psychological determinants of PGA are appropriate to support this important role. This was a cross-sectional, single-center study including consecutive ambulatory RA patients. Data collection comprised swollen 28-joint count (SJC28), tender 28-joint count (TJC28), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, PGA, pain, fatigue, function, anxiety, depression, happiness, personality traits, and comorbidities. Remission was categorized using American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism Boolean-based criteria: remission, near-remission (only PGA &gt;1), and nonremission. A binary definition without PGA (3v-remission) was also studied. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to identify explanatory variables of PGA in each remission state. A total of 309 patients were included (remission 9.4%, near-remission 37.2%, and nonremission 53.4%). Patients in near-remission were indistinguishable from remission regarding disease activity, but described a disease impact similar to those in nonremission. In multivariable analyses, PGA in near-remission was explained (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;adjusted&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.50) by fatigue, pain, anxiety, and function. Fatigue and pain had no relationship with disease activity measures. In RA, a consensually acceptable level of disease activity (SJC28, TJC28, and CRP level ≤1) does not equate to low disease impact: a large proportion of these patients are considered in nonremission solely due to PGA. PGA mainly reflects fatigue, pain, function, and psychological domains, which are inadequate to define the target for immunosuppressive therapy.

18178593	Journal Article	There is a lack of agreement on assessing disease activity in patients with RA and determining when the RA treatment should be changed or continued. A panel of rheumatologists was convened to develop guidelines to assess adequacy of disease control, focusing on the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The Research and Development/University of California in Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) Appropriateness Method was used to evaluate disease control adequacy. After a literature review, 108 scenarios were developed to simulate situations most likely to be encountered in clinical practice and rated on a 9-point scale by a 10-member expert panel. Final appropriateness rankings for the scenarios were as follows: 37% \&#39;appropriate\&#39;, 48% \&#39;inappropriate\&#39;, and 16% \&#39;neutral\&#39;. The panelists felt that patients with disease control in the \&#39;appropriate\&#39; range have adequate control with their current therapy, whereas those in the \&#39;inappropriate\&#39; range should be considered for a change in therapy. Those in \&#39;neutral\&#39; areas should have their therapy reviewed carefully. The panelists recommended that the clinically active joint count should be considered the most important decision factor. In patients with no clinically active joints, regardless of other factors no change in therapy was felt to be warranted. Patients with five or more active joints should be considered inadequately treated, and in patients with one to four active joints other variables must be considered in the decision to change therapy. These preliminary guidelines will assist the clinician in determining when a patient\&#39;s clinical situation warrants therapy escalation and when continuing the current regimen would be appropriate.

24690143	Comparative Study	Comparative effectiveness research has recently attracted considerable attention. The Comparative Effectiveness Registry to study Therapies for Arthritis and Inflammatory Conditions (CERTAIN) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of adult patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). CERTAIN uses the existing Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) network of participating private and academic sites in order to recruit patients fulfilling the 1987 ACR criteria that have at least moderate disease activity. Patients starting or switching biologic agents either anti-TNF therapy or a non anti-TNF biologic are eligible for enrollment, depending on the treatment selected by their physician. Enrollment is expected to be completed by March of 2014, and 2711 patients will participate in the study. As of October 7th 2013, 2234 patients have been enrolled. Patient visits and laboratory blood work are mandated every three months for one year. Safety data is collected through one year and beyond. The primary comparative effectiveness endpoint is attainment of low RA disease activity at one year among patients who have been exposed to at least one prior TNF-α inhibitor agent prior to enrollment. Multiple secondary effectiveness and safety endpoints will be addressed by investigating the entire population enrolled (naïve and biologic experienced). The unique design features of CERTAIN will inform comparative effectiveness and safety questions for choosing biologic agents for the management of RA.

25054597	Journal Article	Fatigue is a highly subjective and extremely common symptom in patients with rheumatoid arthritis although it is difficult to characterize and define. The aim of this study was to assess fatigue in a cohort of Brazilian patients, and to analyze the relationship between fatigue and disease-specific variables. 371 Brazilian patients diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria were prospectively investigated. Demographic, clinical and laboratorial data were obtained from hospitals records. The number of painful joints, bone mass index, disease duration, quality of life, functional capacity, anxiety and depression were recorded. Fatigue was evaluated using the subscale of Fatigue Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-FATIGUE scale). The median fatigue score was 42.0 (10.0), negatively correlated with functional capacity (-0.507; P &lt; 0.001), anxiety and depression (-0.542 and -0.545; P &lt; 0.001 respectively), and predominantly with physical domain of Short Form 36-item quality of life questionnaire (SF-36P: 0.584; P &lt; 0.001). The scores were not associated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (-0.118; P &lt; 0.05), C-reactive protein (-0.089; P &lt; 0.05), disease activity (-0.250; P &lt; 0.001) or the number of painful joints (-0.135; P &lt; 0.01). Confidence interval of 95% was applied for all measures. In this series of Brazilian patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we suggest a new significance for fatigue complains as an independent parameter not related with number of painful joints, disease or inflammatory activity scores. Psychological and functional impairments appear to be more related to fatigue. Additional studies and inclusion of standard measures for monitoring fatigue complains are required.

1281104	Journal Article	Noradrenergic (NA) and peptidergic nerve fibres are present in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs, distributing with the vasculature, trabecular and capsular smooth muscle, and within the parenchyma among cells of the immune system. NA nerve terminals directly abut lymphocytes and macrophages in spleen and lymph nodes. In these organs, norepinephrine has fulfilled the basic criteria for neurotransmission with cells of the immune system as targets. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated NA modulation of primary and secondary antibody responses, cytotoxic T cell responses, natural killer cell activity, and proliferation and differentiation of both T and B lymphocytes. Substance P (SP) has been shown to modulate inflammatory responses, lymphocyte proliferation, and other immunologic reactivity. We investigated the role of NA and SP nerve fibres within lymph nodes in experimental allergic auto-immune arthritis in Lewis rats. Denervation of NA nerve fibres in popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes with 6-hydroxy-dopamine resulted in earlier onset and enhanced severity of arthritic changes as well as inflammation in bilaterally induced experimental arthritis, while denervation of SP nerve fibres in popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes with capsaicin resulted in delayed onset and diminished severity of the inflammatory changes ipsilaterally, and prevention of contralateral arthritic changes in unilaterally induced experimental arthritis. These findings suggest that NA and SP nerve fibres in lymph nodes can modulate the time course of onset and the severity of experimental arthritis in Lewis rats. These modulatory effects are distinctly different from the effects of NA and SP nerve fibres in the joints themselves.

16273792	Comparative Study	In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory activity cannot be measured using one single variable. For this reason the Disease Activity Score (DAS). has been developed. The DAS is a clinical index of RA disease activity that combines information from swollen joints, tender joints, the acute phase response and general health. The DAS-based European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria were developed to measure individual response in clinical trials. The EULAR response criteria classify individual patients as non-, moderate, or good responders, dependent on the extent of change and the level of disease activity reached.

28870177	Journal Article	Chinese external therapy (CET) is a topical application with mainly Chinese herb medicine therapy with thousands of years of historical implications and is a clinical routine that is commonly used for relieving joint-related symptoms in patients with arthritis in Chinese hospitals. However, there is a paucity of modern medical evidence to support its effectiveness and safety. Thus, we propose to implement a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using, as the experimental intervention, topical application of a hospital-compounded gel preparation of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF). This study will be an 8-week double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at Guang\&#39;anmen Hospital in Beijing, China, and 168 patients with moderately active RA will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to apply a topical gel preparation containing TwHF or placebo. The primary outcome variable will be the proportion of subjects, by study group, to achieve a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology criteria (ACR20) by week 8. Secondary outcome measures to be assessed at weeks 4 or 8 will include: measurement of ACR20 response rate at week 4, ACR50 response rate, the changes in DAS28 score, and joint synovitis classification assessment monitored by musculoskeletal ultrasound. Safety evaluations conducted at weeks 4, 8 and 12 will be based on spontaneous complaints by the study subjects, but special emphasis will be focused on cutaneous allergy and alterations of menstruation in premenopausal female participants. Statistical analyses will be performed using the intention to treat analysis data set. This proposed clinical trail is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CET based on a single topically-applied agent in a relatively large patient population with RA. This study protocol gives a detailed description of the usage and dosage of the topical compound TwHF gel and the methodology of this study. In addition, it is hoped that the outcomes of this study will be viewed as supporting the generalizability of CET in the setting of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The results of this study are expected to have important public health implications for Asian RA patients that currently utilize CET as a complimentary treatment.

28843845	Journal Article	Bergenin is a unique C-glycoside natural product possessing anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity. It is hydrophilic molecule and stable under acidic conditions however is unstable at neutral-basic pH conditions. The rate of degradation is directly proportional to the increase in pH which might be one of the reasons for its low oral bioavailability. Thus, herein our objective was to improve its stability using prodrug strategy. Various ester and ether prodrugs were synthesized and studied for lipophilicity, chemical stability and enzymatic hydrolysis in plasma/esterase. The stability of synthesized prodrugs was evaluated in buffers at different pH, in biorelevant media such as SGF, SIF, rat plasma and in esterase enzyme. All prodrugs displayed significantly improved lipophilicity compared with bergenin, which was in accordance with the criteria of drug-like compounds. Acetyl ester 4a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; appeared to be the most promising prodrug as it remained stable at gastric/intestinal pH and was completely transformed to the parent compound bergenin in plasma as desired for an ideal prodrug. The data presented herein, will help in designing stable prodrugs of unstable molecules with desired physicochemical properties in structurally similar chemotypes.

23687262	Journal Article	The NLRP3-inflammasome, implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, has been analysed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Relative gene expression of NLRP3-inflammasome components was characterised in PBMCs of 29 patients receiving infliximab. A total of 1278 Caucasian patients with RA from the Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis Genetics and Genomics Study Syndicate (BRAGGSS) cohort receiving tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists (infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept) were genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), spanning the genes NLRP3, MEFV and CARD8. Regression analyses were performed to test for association between genotype and susceptibility and treatment response (disease activity score across 28 joints (DAS28) and EULAR improvement criteria) at 6 months, with secondary expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses. At baseline, gene expression of ASC, MEFV, NLRP3-FL, NLRP3-SL and CASP1 were significantly higher compared with controls whereas CARD8 was lower in the patients. Caspase-1 and interleukin-18 levels were significantly raised in patients with RA. SNPs in NLRP3 showed association with RA susceptibility and EULAR response to anti-TNF in the BRAGGSS cohort, and in monocytes but not B cells, in eQTL analysis of 283 healthy controls. CARD8 SNPs were associated with RA susceptibility and DAS28 improvement in response to anti-TNF and eQTL effects in monocytes and B cells. This study found evidence of modulation of the NLRP3-inflammasome in patients with RA prior to receiving infliximab and some evidence of association for SNPs at NLRP3 and CARD8 loci with RA susceptibility and response to anti-TNF. The SNPs associated with susceptibility/response are not the main eQTL variants for either locus, and the associations with treatment response require replication in an independent cohort.

22505700	Journal Article	To evaluate the effects of double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) in combination with leflunomide and methotrexate (MTX) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected inflammatory changes (synovitis and bone edema) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with high disease activity. Sixty RA patients with highly active disease of 6 months\&#39; to 3 years\&#39; duration were randomized to receive DFPP in combination with leflunomide and MTX (DFPP group), and leflunomide plus MTX (no-DFPP group). The primary endpoint was the improvement in MRI-detected synovitis from baseline over 6 months. Secondary endpoint variables included DAS28 remission and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria responses for 6 consecutive months. The study achieved significant improvement in synovitis and bone edema, with significantly lower synovitis and bone edema scores in the DFPP group compared with the no-DFPP group (p &lt; 0.001). Synovitis scores in 48.39% of patients (15/31) in the DFPP group were 0 at Month 6. Bone edema scores in 32.26% of patients (10/31) in the DFPP group were 0 at Month 6. We observed significantly greater ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, and ACR90 responses and DAS28 remission rates in the DFPP group than in the no-DFPP group (p &lt; 0.001). Sustained DAS28 remission and ACR90 response for at least 6 months were achieved in 100% of patients receiving DFPP therapy. The combination of DFPP and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) was superior to DMARD alone for reducing MRI-detected signs of synovitis and bone edema in patients with early highly active RA. DFPP therapy enabled rapid and more complete suppression of inflammation in patients with highly active RA. Nearly half the patients (48.39%) who had received DFPP therapy achieved both clinical remission and imaging remission, a state characterized as true remission.

18240260	Journal Article	To evaluate the effectiveness of the polymyalgia rheumatica activity score (PMR-AS) in diagnosing disease flares. Rheumatologists prospectively included 89 patients with PMR (mean +/- SD age 74.6 +/- 6.2 years, mean +/- SD disease duration 1.6 +/- 2.2 years). At each visit, the rheumatologist assessed disease activity using a visual analog scale (VAS) and recorded whether a disease flare was diagnosed and/or the glucocorticoid dose changed. Overall, 137 visits including 49 pairs (allowing intraindividual comparisons) were available; a disease flare was diagnosed at 32 visits. We evaluated statistical associations linking flare diagnosis to the PMR-AS, each of its components (VAS, VAS for pain, C-reactive protein, morning stiffness, and elevation of upper limbs), and changes in these parameters between 2 visits. Associations with disease flare diagnosis were strongest for PMR-AS scores &gt; or =9.35 (agreement 92%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 85.8-95.7%, kappa = 0.78; sensitivity 96.6%, 95% CI 80.4-99.8; specificity 90.7%, 95% CI 83.2-95.2) and for DeltaPMR-AS scores &gt; or =6.6 (agreement 98%, 95% CI 88.0-99.9%, kappa = 0.95; sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 74.7-100; specificity 97.1%, 95% CI 82.9-99.8). Other parameters showed weaker diagnostic performance. This study supplies new evidence that the PMR-AS is useful for monitoring PMR activity in everyday practice and for managing glucocorticoid tapering. PMR activity changes seem even more relevant than absolute values.

27908254	Journal Article	Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease with destructive pattern. Patients are suffering from pain and decreased functional outcome as the disease progress. Certain joints are widely discussed in the literature as well as shoulder girdle, but shoulder girdle surgical treatment options\&#39; indications and superiorities to each other were not compared entirely. Treatment options, such as; synovectomy and bursectomy, resection interposition arthroplasty, hemiarthroplasty, humeral resurfacing arthroplasty, anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty and reverse shoulder arthroplasty, are examined for their timing, advantages, disadvantages and comparison. Patients\&#39; age is the main factor about the decision making in rheumatoid arthritis. Young aged patients demand high activity level, but as a result loosening of the implant is frequently encountered. Thus, the protection of the bone stock as much as possible must be the priority. For a young patient with disabling pain should be evaluated for less invasive surgeries such as; synovectomy and bursectomy, resection interposition arthroplasty and also for hemiarthroplasty for preservation of glenoid bone stock. But rotator cuff status, glenoid bone stock evaluation and grading of the glenoid defect become more important in old aged patients and the correct decision making can only be made by combining these factors. Age, functional demand, rotator cuff status and adequacy of glenoid bone stock are defined as major criteria for an optimal treatment. Even though RA patients require additional care for a good functional outcome; with correct decision-making, high quality of life is achievable.

28464909	Journal Article	Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) is a specific subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) defined according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria. We aimed to characterize the clinical features and treatment regimens in an inception cohort of children with ERA. We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional, multicenter cohort study including subjects diagnosed with ERA between 1989 and 2012. Patients all fulfilled the ILAR criteria for ERA within 3 months of initial presentation to the rheumatology clinic. Differences in the prevalence of clinical criteria across study sites and by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 status were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum or chi-square test, as appropriate. Two hundred thirty-four children met the inclusion criteria. Their median age at diagnosis was 11.6 years, and 59% were HLA-B27-positive. Sixty-nine percent had enthesitis and arthritis at the time of diagnosis. Seventy-eight percent had a pauciarticular onset. The prevalence of all ILAR criteria at diagnosis, except arthritis and acute anterior uveitis, differed significantly across sites (all p &lt; 0.01). Medication use varied significantly across sites for children with peripheral arthritis (p &lt; 0.001), but not for sacroiliitis or enthesitis only. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were the most commonly prescribed treatments, with anti-TNF agents primarily being initiation for sacroiliitis. HLA-B27 positivity was associated with male sex, higher active joint count, sacroiliitis, and higher disease activity at disease onset. The majority of children had a pauciarticular onset, and several statistically significant clinical differences based on HLA-B27 status were identified. The observed heterogeneity in clinical presentation across sites reflects either true differences in patient populations or differences in how the ILAR criteria are being applied.

1710721	English Abstract	Studies of coagulation hemostasis in 108 patients with rheumatoid arthritis have revealed that high blood coagulation is characteristic of this disease, and a number of coagulation parameters (antithrombin III, fibrinogen, fibrinolytic activity, ethanol test) point to intravascular microthrombi formation (disseminated intravascular coagulation). Along with hemostasis investigations, Willebrand\&#39;s factor levels were measured in the blood plasma of 44 patients. Enhancement of the inflammatory process activity was found to be associated with elevation of this factor level and augmentation of the blood coagulation activity. These results permit considering Willebrand\&#39;s factor as one of the diagnostic criteria of thrombophilic conditions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

29102156	Journal Article	To investigate effectiveness of systematic switching treatment from innovator infliximab to biosimilar infliximab, and its associated factors. In this prospective observational study, all adult patients receiving maintenance therapy with innovator infliximab in Cochin University Hospital were systematically switched to biosimilar infliximab. Effectiveness was assessed by the retention rate of biosimilar infliximab at the time of the third infusion. Sensitivity analyses for effectiveness included changes of disease activity parameters and infliximab trough levels between baseline and the last visit as well as the occurrence of adverse events leading to drug discontinuation. Factors associated with biosimilar infliximab discontinuation at the last visit were explored. A total of 260 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 31 rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 131 axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and 64 inflammatory bowel diseases. The retention rate was 85% (221/260 patients) at the time of the third biosimilar infusion. Between baseline and the last visit (mean follow-up of 34 weeks), 59 patients (23%) discontinued biosimilar infliximab, mainly due to experienced inefficacy (n = 47, 80%). No clinical or biological factors were associated with biosimilar discontinuation. No serious adverse events occurred. No change in objective disease activity parameters or infliximab trough levels was detected. However, a significant increase of BASDAI (2.94 ± 2.20 vs. 3.18 ± 2.21, P = 0.046, before vs. after switch, respectively) was observed in patients with axSpA. Innovator infliximab was re-established in 47/59 patients (80%). No changes in drug trough levels or objective parameters were observed after the systematic switch to biosimilar infliximab in a real clinical practice setting. Only changes in patient-reported outcomes were observed, suggesting attribution effects rather than pharmacological differences.

23505235	Journal Article	Anaemia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is prototypical of the chronic disease type and is often neglected in clinical practice. We studied anaemia in relation to disease activity, medications and radiographic progression. Data were collected between 1996 and 2007 over a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Anaemia was defined according to WHO (♀ haemoglobin&lt;12 g/dl, ♂: haemoglobin&lt;13 g/dl), or alternative criteria. Anaemia prevalence was studied in relation to disease parameters and pharmacological therapy. Radiographic progression was analysed in 9731 radiograph sets from 2681 patients in crude longitudinal regression models and after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including the clinical disease activity score with the 28-joint count for tender and swollen joints and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28ESR) or the clinical disease activity index (cDAI), synthetic antirheumatic drugs and antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. Anaemia prevalence decreased from more than 24% in years before 2001 to 15% in 2007. Erosions progressed significantly faster in patients with anaemia (p&lt;0.001). Adjusted models showed these effects independently of clinical disease activity and other indicators of disease severity. Radiographic damage progression rates were increasing with severity of anaemia, suggesting a \&#39;dose-response effect\&#39;. The effect of anaemia on damage progression was maintained in subgroups of patients treated with TNF blockade or corticosteroids, and without non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Anaemia in RA appears to capture disease processes that remain unmeasured by established disease activity measures in patients with or without TNF blockade, and may help to identify patients with more rapid erosive disease.

9377853	Case Reports	Liver abnormalities in the course of Adult Onset Still\&#39;s Disease (AOSD), both in form of hepatomegaly and elevation of hepatic enzymes, have been reported in up to three-quarts of the affected patients. These abnormalities may reflect disease activity or may be induced by drugs. Only in a few of this patients a liver biopsy was performed. However liver histology has shown, generally, non specific abnormalities or even normal pictures. We have recently observed a 47-year-old woman with a febrile illness started five months before, who after pertinent investigation was diagnosed as AOSD (according to criteria of Yamaguchi et al.). Apart from laboratory findings characteristic of an inflammatory disease, in absence of drug therapies the biochemical data showed raised levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and aminoglutamil transferase. Serological tests for either viral hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV, HCV) or other viruses were negative. Ultrasonographic examination of gallbladder and bile ducts did not find gallstones or other abnormalities. A liver biopsy was performed, which histopathologic examination showed moderate fatty methamorphosis with focal areas of hepatocellular swelling with minimal necrosis, mild Kuppfer cell hyperplasia, portal and sinusoidal infiltrates of mononuclear cells. This picture consisted with the diagnosis of an acute unspecific reactive hepatitis.

2151575	Clinical Trial	One hundred and seventeen outpatients (87 females and 30 males; mean age 53.5 +/- 13.2 years) encompassing the 1987 American Rheumatism Association criteria for rheumatoid arthritis were admitted into a multicentre open study. All patients were evaluated at baseline and after two months of therapy with etodolac (400 or 600 mg/die per os). Clinical evaluation was performed by using the following indicators: viso-analogic scale of global pain; index of pain on active movements; index for sleep disturbances, and duration of morning stiffness. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was chosen for the laboratory evaluation of the activity of the disease. One hundred patients received 400 mg/die, while only 17 patients received 600 mg/die; 115 patients undertook the evaluation after treatment, whereas two patients were considered \&quot;lost to follow-up\&quot;. One hundred and five patients completed the study while ten patients withdrew (seven because of inefficacy and three because of intolerance of the gastrointestinal tract). Only nine patients presented side-effects, among these: five were judged etodolac-related, whereas four were not. A complete resolution of all these side-effects was achieved in all cases. Significant improvements were registered for all the four clinical variables. At the end of the study 56.5% of patients expressed a preference for etodolac, 16.5% for one of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs previously taken and 27% did not answer or were not able to express any definite preference. Strict concordance was found between the degree of clinical improvement achieved and the preferences expressed. The laboratory parameters did not reveal any variation at the end of the study in comparison with baseline values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	NA	International journal of clinical pharmacology research	4.Bronze	Effectiveness and safety of etodolac in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: a multicentre two-months\&#39; open study.	1990	First Institute of Medical Pathology, University of Pisa, Italy.	0.0	[\&#39;eng\&#39;]	Switzerland	Puccetti L, Soletti A, Petrini G, Remorini E, Zuccotti M, Bazzichi L, Ciompi ML
24314299	Journal Article	Adipokines such as adiponectin, leptin, and visfatin/nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) have recently emerged as pro-inflammatory mediators involved in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to determine whether serum adipokine levels independently predicted early radiographic disease progression in early RA. In total, 791 patients were included from the prospective Etude et Suivi des POlyarthrites Indifférenciées Récentes (ESPOIR) cohort who met the American College of Rheumatology-European League Against Rheumatism criteria for RA (n = 632) or had undifferentiated arthritis (UA) (n = 159). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess baseline serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and visfatin/NAMPT. In the RA group, we tested the association of serum adipokine levels and (a) baseline radiographic damage and (b) radiographic disease progression, defined as a change &gt;0 or ≥ 5 in total Sharp-van der Heijde Score (∆SHS) between inclusion and 1 year (∆SHS ≥1 or rapid radiographic progression: ∆SHS ≥5), adjusting for confounders (age, sex, body-mass index, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein level, Disease Activity Score in 28 joints, Health Assessment Questionnaire score, autoantibody status, steroid use, and radiographic evidence of RA damage at inclusion). Adiponectin level was independently associated with baseline total SHS (adjusted β = 0.12; P = 0.006). It was also associated with ∆SHS ≥1 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.84 (1.25 to 2.72)) involving erosive as well as narrowing disease progression (aOR = 1.73 (1.17 to 2.55) and 1.93 (1.04 to 3.57), respectively). Serum adiponectin level predicted ∆SHS ≥5 (aOR = 2.0 (1.14 to 3.52)). Serum leptin level was independently associated only with ∆SHS &gt;0 (aOR = 1.59 (1.05 to 2.42)). Conversely, serum visfatin/NAMPT level and radiographic disease progression were unrelated. Considering the receiver-operated characteristic curves, the best adiponectin cut-offs were 4.14 μg/ml for ∆SHS ≥1 and 6.04 μg/ml for ∆SHS ≥5, with a good specificity (58% and 75% for ∆SHS ≥1 and ∆SHS ≥5, respectively) and high negative predictive values (75% and 92% for ∆SHS ≥1 or ∆SHS ≥5, respectively). Serum adiponectin level is a simple useful biomarker associated with early radiographic disease progression in early RA, independent of RA-confounding factors and metabolic status.

18843772	Journal Article	.To evaluate associations of growth velocity with inflammatory markers and cumulative dose of glucocorticoid in a cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) followed during 1 year. Seventy-nine patients were evaluated. Disease activity was evaluated by a pediatric rheumatologist. Anthropometric data were classified according to the World Health Organization standards. Tanner growth velocity curves were used; values below the Z-score &lt; or = -2 were considered low growth velocity. Serum concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) were measured by ELISA, and values &gt; 1 pg/ml were considered elevated. The prevalence of low growth velocity was 25.3%, and it was associated with active disease on followup visit, elevated IL-6, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and higher cumulative glucocorticoid doses. In the multiple linear regression with growth velocity as the dependent variable, only elevated IL-6 level was independently and negatively associated with growth velocity. Low growth velocity is highly prevalent in children with JIA. Elevated IL-6 levels seem to have an important negative influence on growth in these children, while total glucocorticoid exposure appears to be a secondary factor.

12649699	Comparative Study	By now many authors regard arthroscopic synovectomy an integral part of therapeutic treatment of many rheumatic diseases with favourable results on post operating course and clinical picture in the long term. The pathologic synovial tissue during articular inflammatory rheumatism is well known to have a damaging effect responsible of early cartilage injury, as well as symptomatic action (e.g. articular stiffness, effusion, pain, functional limitation). Therefore to value the removal of such a tissue you should think of the secondary prevention of cartilage injury, besides the symptomatic point of view. Since 1996 we performed 190 arthroscopic synovectomy, the adopted criteria of judgement were: pain (spontaneous, during active and passive movements), effusion or swelling presence, articular range and cartilage state (evaluated during arthroscopy according to Outerbridg\&#39;s classification). 70% of the cases showed good results and six years later the beginning of this activity we retain arthroscopic synovectomy as a valid help in articular inflammatory rheumatism treatment.

21031285	Journal Article	To present the evidence for the efficacy of comprehensive rehabilitation in a warm climate of patients with a wide variety of rheumatic diseases. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken, searching in PubMed, Cinahl, Pedro, SweMed and Embase from 1970 to 2010, and using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system) criteria. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, moderate evidence was found for reduction of disease activity, pain, fatigue, and global disease impact. The evidence was also moderate that comprehensive rehabilitation in a warm climate did not improve fitness or reduce activity limitation beyond levels reached by rehabilitation in Scandinavia. Among patients with ankylosing spondylitis, low evidence was found for reduction of disease activity, pain, joint range of motion, activity limitation, and global disease impact. In groups with mixed rheumatic diagnoses, low evidence was found for reduction of pain, activity limitation, global disease impact and improved health-related quality of life. No studies on psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia or osteoporosis were found. Well-designed studies to validate and improve the low-to-moderate evidence found for the efficacy of comprehensive rehabilitation in a warm climate among patients with inflammatory rheumatic disease are greatly needed.

27094444	Journal Article	To compare the presentation of seropositive and seronegative early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve patients classified according to the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria. All patients had symptom duration from first swollen joint &lt;2 years and were DMARD naïve with an indication for DMARD treatment. Patients were stratified as seropositive (positive rheumatoid factor (RF)+ and/or anticitrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)+) or seronegative (RF- and ACPA-), and disease characteristics were compared between groups. A total of 234 patients were included, and 36 (15.4%) were seronegative. Ultrasonography (US) scores for joints (median 55 vs 25, p&lt;0.001) and tendons (median 3 vs 0, p&lt;0.001), number of swollen joints (median 17 vs 8, p&lt;0.001), disease activity score (DAS; mean 3.9 vs 3.4, p=0.03) and physician global assessment (mean 49.1 vs 38.9, p=0.006) were significantly higher in seronegative patients compared with seropositive. Total van der Heijde-modified Sharp score, Richie Articular Index and patient-reported outcome measures were similar between groups. Seronegative patients had higher levels of inflammation, assessed both clinically and by US, than seropositive patients. These differences may reflect the high number of involved joints required for seronegative patients to fulfil the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA. NCT01205854; Pre-results.

17369281	Comparative Study	To compare disease activity and the improvement of disease activity evaluated between by Disease Activity Score 28 using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and by DAS28 using C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Data from 3073 RA patients registered in the large cohort database (NinJa: National Database of Rheumatic Diseases by iR-net in Japan) of 2003 was used to calculate DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP and disease activities were evaluated. Improvements in disease activities were also evaluated according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria in 1482 RA patients whose DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP could be calculated from data for both 2002 and 2003. The mean value of DAS28-CRP (3.59, SD 1.25) was significantly smaller than that of mean DAS28-ESR (4.31, SD 1.32) (p &lt; 0.0001). The number of patients who satisfied the criteria of remission was 297 (9.7%) in DAS28-ESR versus 705 (22.9%) in DAS28-CRP and the number of patients with high disease activity was 842 (27.4%) versus 357 (11.6%) for DAS28-ESR and DAS28-CRP, respectively; there was a significant difference between the two (p &lt; 0.0001). Change of respective DAS28 was significantly correlated (DeltaDAS28-ESR -0.05, SD 1.14 versus DeltaDAS28-CRP -0.10, SD 1.10) (p &lt; 0.0001); however, the number of \&quot;good response\&quot; patients was significantly different (p &lt; 0.03) between DAS28-ESR (97 patients, 6.5%) and DAS28-CRP (136 patients, 9.2%). DAS28-CRP significantly underestimated disease activity and overestimated the improvement in disease activity compared with DAS28-ESR. DAS28-CRP should be evaluated using different criteria from that for DAS28-ESR.

964883	English Abstract	Empirical medicine has three main supporting pillars: physical treatment, dietetics and phytotherapy. In this area of medicine, a number of therapeutical methods have been evolved which stand up to investigations employing scientific criteria, and which, in consequence, have become officially recognized by medical science. Examples are: diet rich in bulkage, digitalis, products of Papaver somniferum (Poppy) and salicylates. The acceptance of phytotherapeutic agents into the drug armamentarium of scientific medicine presupposes the availability of test methods suitable to demonstrate their effectiveness. Quite a number of remedies that have always been firmly anchored in empirical medicine, but which was applied regularly only by the nature healer, have suddenly, in the light of new test methods, been shown to be effective medicines; thus, for example, onions and garlic are good for thrombotic processes and hyperglycaemia, carminatives for sphincter spasms in the gastrointestinal tract, and alcohol is an appetite-stimulating stomachic. This fact, the limited applicability of the information obtained from animal experiments, and the further fact that even test results obtained in human subjects cannot be applied on a world-wide basis, exhort us to take care not to subscribe to an all-too apodictic classification of therapeutic measures into effective and noneffective. A further point for consideration is that the administration even of what is only a supposed remedy, can trigger or promote healing simply on the strength of the action of the physician. Scientific thinking is an indispensible precondition of the physician\&#39;s activity--to consider it as the beginning and end of all things medical, however, is simply to demonstrate a narrowness of outlook.

11188854	English Abstract	Cartilage is a specialized connective tissue. It contains few cells into an extracell matrix. The matrix mainly constituents are collagen and proteoglycans. Its degradation depends on synoviocytes activity, that secrete metalloproteases, agents to proteoglycans catabolism. There are two types of synoviocytes: macrophagics (type \&quot;A:\&#39;) and fibroblastics (type \&quot;B\&quot;). The proteoglycan destruction can be LT-dependent or LT-independent. The aim of this work is synoviocytes function ex vívo study, free immune system influence. In order to do it, heparinized synovial fluid samples were obtained from 6 osteoarthritic (OA) and 6 arthritic (RA) both sex untreated patients, diagnosed according ACR criteria, which disease duration was longer than 6 months. Patients average age was 70 +/- 2 years. Control samples were synovial fluid from traumatic arthritis or non inflammatory bone-muscle pathology. Synovial fluid was centifugated at 1500 g for 30 minutes to isolate synoviocytes. Sediment containing cells was 6 hs incubed with Dulbecco-Eagles media, that has HEPES Gibco (26 mM); NaHCO3 (0.5 g/I); glutamine (2 mM), streptomicine (100 mg/l), G-penicillin (1 U/ml); anphotericine B (2.5 mg/l). Cells calification and viability were cytopathologically determined. Before and after incubation, collagenase activity was measured by ELISA-double-sandwich, using 10 micrograms/ml monoclonal anti-MMPs in phosphate-buffer-saline. The antigen-antibody complex production with inespecific proteins was blocked by bovine seric albumine. Streptavidin peroxidase was added and washed with 2,2,azin,di(3-ethyl-benztazoilinsuiphonic) acid to develop color. The link of labeled antibody by absorbance at 410 nm was determined in ELISA-spectrophothometer. RA patients earlier MMPs synoviocytes production was 1373 +/- 115 ng/ml. Then 6 hs incubation 2143 +/- 132 ng/ml was reached. The increase (56%) had high significance (p &lt; 0.0001). OA earlier MMPs cells production was 276 +/- 23 ng/ml, but after incubation it reached 542 +/- 47 ng/ml. (96% increased with highly significativa difference too: p &lt; 0.0001). Microscopic study was carried out before and after incubation, and shows a lot of synoviocytes with plenty of cytopiasme when the collagenase leveis were highest. On the contrary, when low MMPs production by synovial fluid, as no incubated osteoarthritic material, a few cells containing picnotics nucleous were observed. Significant quantitative differences in AR and OA enzymatic secretion were observed. Although in rheumatoid arthritic MMPs leveis synoviocytes production were 4.6 times than OA levels, after 6 hs incubation percentage of increase in OA cells secretion was highest. Described results confirm MMP-1 synthesis by synoviocytes, and these levels correlate with inflammation, more pronounced in acute (RA) than chronic pathology (OA). Synoviocyte incubation let us to test disease changes in synovial fluid according to cells number and phagocytic activity. Authors agree to assert that synovial fluid may reflect what is happening in an articular cartilago, because SF provides markers of joint disease. MMPs are giving information about pathways involved in OA and RA cartilage degradation.

22505708	Comparative Study	To describe the frequency of remission in an early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) cohort. The frequency of remission was evaluated, based on 8 definitions including the Boolean-based American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria. Of 369 patients, remission at 12 months ranged from 18% according to the ACR/EULAR clinical trial criteria to 40% according to the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) &lt; 2.6. Higher tender joint count, swollen joint count, and physician global scores were seen for DAS28-based definitions, and patient global assessment (PtGA) scores were almost 5-fold higher for DAS28 remission. Remission is achievable in ERA but its frequency differs according to the remission definition applied. Adoption of the new ACR/EULAR definition will limit the number classified as in remission, especially if the PtGA criteria are rated high for reasons other than inflammatory arthritis.

7436579	Journal Article	The leucocyte infiltration observed in histological lesions from patients with juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) suggests the possibility of an abnormal leucochemotaxis. A group of 21 patients with JCA which fulfilled the Eular criteria (Oslo Symposium 77) were investigated with a paired group of 21 children. The chemotactic assay used was a microscopical direct observation technique. The chemotaxis of the patient\&#39;s leucocytes was in the normal range, as was the chemotactic activity of their serum. However, their serum had an enhancing effect on the chemotaxis of normal leucocytes. An attempt to characterise this chemotactic enhancing factor was undertaken. It was not dialysable, heat stable, destroyed at 80 degrees C, nor precipitated by ammonium sulphate at 45%; it could be migrated on PAGE with albumin, and, by precipitation with a goat antihuman albumin antiserum, seemed to be bound to the albumin fraction. The function of this factor in the regulation of the inflammatory process is discussed.

29680162	Journal Article	To assess baseline predictors of long-term functional disability in patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA). We conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1990 to 2017 using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Studies were included if (i) they were prospective observational studies, (ii) all patients had IA with symptom duration ≤2 years at baseline, (iii) follow-up was at least 5 years, and (iv) baseline predictors of HAQ score at long-term follow-up (i.e., ≥5 years following baseline) were assessed. Information on the included studies and estimates of the association between baseline variables and long-term HAQ scores were extracted from the full manuscripts. Of 1037 abstracts identified by the search strategy, 37 met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the review. Older age at baseline and female gender were reported to be associated with higher long-term HAQ scores in the majority of studies assessing these relationships, as were higher baseline HAQ and greater pain scores (total patients included in analyses reporting significant associations/total number of patients analysed: age 9.8k/10.7k (91.6%); gender 9.9k/11.3k (87.4%); HAQ 4.0k/4.0k (99.0%); pain 2.8k/2.9k (93.6%)). Tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and DAS28 were also reported to predict long-term HAQ score; other disease activity measures were less consistent (tender joints 2.1k/2.5k (84.5%); erythrocyte sedimentation rate 1.6k/2.2k (72.3%); DAS28 888/1.1k (79.2%); swollen joints 684/2.6k (26.6%); C-reactive protein 279/510 (54.7%)). Rheumatoid factor (RF) and erosions were not useful predictors (RF 546/4.6k (11.9%); erosions 191/2.7k (7.0%)), whereas the results for anti-citrullinated protein antibody positivity were equivocal (ACPA 2.0k/3.8k (52.9%)). Baseline age, gender, HAQ and pain scores are associated with long-term disability and knowledge of these may aid the assessment of prognosis.

26606012	Journal Article	Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) frequently have extraintestinal manifestations including arthritis, sacroiliitis, and ankylosing spondylitis. While the treatment of these rheumatological conditions with traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been reported to lead to frequent IBD exacerbation, the safety of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (Coxibs) remains unclear. Our aim is to carry out a meta-analysis to verify if Coxibs, employed to treat rheumatological manifestations, are associated with an increased risk of exacerbation of IBD compared to placebo. A MEDLINE, SCOPUS, ISI-Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE search of all studies published in English from 1965 to April 15, 2015, was conducted. Articles on the safety of Coxibs in patients with IBD were identified using the terms \&quot;Coxibs or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or COX-2 inhibitors AND inflammatory bowel disease.\&quot; The criteria of exclusion of the studies were NSAIDs administration within 2 weeks before starting Coxibs. For the \&quot;proportion\&quot; meta-analysis, the studies had to report the proportion of patients that had to discontinue the Coxibs therapy due to an exacerbation of IBD; for the \&quot;relative risk\&quot; meta-analysis, the studies had to be prospective with a comparison between patients taking Coxibs and patients taking placebo. Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts of references retrieved from the literature search and selected potentially relevant studies. Differences in opinion were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached. If an agreement failed to be reached, a third author was consulted. The quality of each study was assessed on a 5-point scale adapted from studies by the Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated disorders and Jadad. The search identified 72 publications of which 7 studies reported the proportion of patients with IBD that had to stop the Coxibs therapy because of a worsening of the activity of IBD. The pooled proportion of flare up of IBD in patients that received Coxibs was 14.4% (95% CI: 6.7-24.4%). There was no statistically significant difference between patients that assumed Coxibs and those that assumed placebo (total fixed effect relative risk = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.39-1.88, P = 0.7). A proportion of patients received maintenance therapy with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and these co-interventions could have protected against a Coxib-induced flare; furthermore, the duration of Coxib assumption in the prospective studies is shorter compared to that of the medical practice. Three of the studies included in our meta-analysis had an insufficient quality but due to the higher number of recruited patients, the studies with a better quality had a higher weight in the final result. Moreover, to assess the relative risk of flare up of IBD only randomized controlled trials have been used in the second meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that Coxibs are safe in most patients with IBD. Controlled trials of Coxibs compared with NSAIDs would be useful, at least in patients suffering from rheumatic pain refractory to standard treatment.

In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, men and women aged &gt; or = 40 years diagnosed with primary OA in the dominant hand were randomly assigned to self-apply topical 1% diclofenac sodium gel (Voltaren Gel) (n = 198) or vehicle (n = 187) to both hands 4 times daily for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measures included OA pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale), total Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN) score, and global rating of disease activity at 4 and 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included onset of efficacy in Weeks 1 and 2, durability of efficacy at 8 weeks, measures of disease activity in the dominant hand, pain intensity in the non-dominant hand, AUSCAN subindices, end of study rating of efficacy, and Osteoarthritis Research Society International response criteria. Diclofenac sodium gel decreased pain intensity scores by 42%-45%, total AUSCAN scores by 35%-40%, and global rating of disease by 36%-40%. Significant differences favoring diclofenac sodium gel over vehicle were observed at Week 4 for pain intensity and AUSCAN, with a trend for global rating of disease activity. At Week 6, diclofenac sodium gel treatment significantly improved each primary outcome measure compared with vehicle. Secondary outcomes generally supported the primary outcomes. The most common treatment-related adverse event (AE) was application-site paresthesia. Most AE were mild. No cardiac events, gastrointestinal bleeding, or ulcers were reported. Topical diclofenac sodium gel was generally well tolerated and effective in primary hand OA. (NCT ID: NCT00171665).

12207202	Clinical Trial	To assess the long term safety and therapeutic action of lornoxicam, a new non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, in rheumatoid arthritis. Open trial was carried out on different dosage schedules of lornoxicam (4 or 8 mg bid and 4mg tid) administered for six to twelve months. Patients of both sexes were enrolled, with classical or definite rheumatoid arthritis according to the A.R.A. criteria. Thirty-four patients (28 F, 6 M) were admitted, mean age (+/- SD) 53.9+/-14.2 years, mean duration of illness 9.2+/-10.7 years. Lornoxicam 8-16 mg/day showed good safety and therapeutic activity in long term treatment. Clinical improvement was limited, but progression of the disease was controlled. No adverse events were complained. Lornoxicam presented a worth-while therapeutic action and a good tolerability in rheumatoid arthritis long term treatment.

19405003	Journal Article	To develop and validate a composite disease activity score for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS). The JADAS includes 4 measures: physician global assessment of disease activity, parent/patient global assessment of well-being, active joint count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These variables are part of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Pediatric 30 (Pedi 30), Pedi 50, and Pedi 70 criteria for improvement. Validation analyses were conducted on &gt;4,500 patients and included assessment of construct validity, discriminant validity, and responsiveness to change. Three versions of the JADAS were tested based on 71-joint (range 0-101), 27-joint (range 0-57), or 10-joint (range 0-40) counts. Statistical performances of the JADAS were compared with those of 2 rheumatoid arthritis composite scores, the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). The JADAS demonstrated good construct validity, yielding strong correlations with JIA activity measures not included in the score and moderate correlations with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire. Correlations obtained for the 3 JADAS versions were comparable, but superior to those yielded by the DAS28 and CDAI. The area under the curve of the JADAS predicted long-term disease outcome, measured as radiographic progression over 3 years. In 2 clinical trials, the JADAS discriminated well between ACR Pedi 30, Pedi 50, and Pedi 70 response and revealed strong responsiveness to clinical change. The JADAS was found to be a valid instrument for assessment of disease activity in JIA and is potentially applicable in standard clinical care, observational studies, and clinical trials.

1014622	English Abstract	The aim of the present study was to determine the significance of the lymphocyte transformation test with phyto-hemagglutinin in connection with the degree of inflammatory activity and serological changes. Lymphocyte transformation test with phytohemagglutinin was performed on 46 of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis active stage, diagnosed according to the New York criteria. In patients with low and moderate inflammatory activity the lymphocyte transformation test has values close to those of the controls. In patients with high inflammatory activity either low values or considerably higher were established as compared with the control group. The values of the test were proved, through the statistical analysis, to be heterogenous quantities in seropositive and seronegative patients.

17471834	Evaluation Studies	The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of combined treatment with cyclosporine A and another disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug in patients with monotherapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis, to find the minimal effective doses of combined drugs, to determine the frequency and type of side-effects, and to analyze causes for drug withdrawal. The study was performed in two groups of rheumatoid arthritis patients diagnosed according to ACR criteria who presented with symptoms of active inflammatory disease in spite of six-month-long treatment with full dose of at least one drug. Patients previously treated with cyclosporine A, with poorly controlled hypertension, and kidney failure were excluded from the study. At the beginning of the study, all patients were on 15 mg prednizone and 1-3 basic drugs. In group I (n = 36 patients), monotherapy was combined with an increasing dose of cyclosporine A (from 1.5-2 to the maximal dose of 5 mg/kg/day). Disease activity was determined according to modified ACR criteria. Improvement was observed in 30 patients (83.3%). Improvement was significant in 5 patients (13.9%), moderate in 11 (30.5%), and slight in 14 (38.9%). No improvement was observed in 6 patients (16.7%). The effective dose was 100-400 mg/day (mean 180.5 mg/day or 2,5-3,0 mg/kg/day). Treatment was terminated in 72.2% of patients, mostly because of side-effects (36.1%). In 16.7% of patients, the cause for termination was lack of early improvement or late recurrence. In group II (n = 11 patients), leflunomide 20 mg/day was added to the previous treatment. Disease activity was estimated according to DAS 28 scale. Combined treatment with cyclosporine A and leflunomide was effective in 43.3% of patients. It was demonstrated that cyclosporine A in combination therapy may cause improvement in patients resistant to other basic drugs. Its effective dose is approx. 2.5-3.0 mg/kg/day. Side-effects requiring drug withdrawal were present in one-fourth of patients and together with non-effective therapy were the most common cause for drug withdrawal. However, it must be emphasized that patients who were qualified to this study had a severe course of the disease resistant to other therapies. In this context, our combination therapy deserves attention.

16881355	Clinical Trial	To study effects of leflunomide on inflammatory and destructive processes in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The trial included 33 patients (27 females and 6 males) with a significant diagnosis of RA (A CR criteria) aged 19 to 60 years and duration of the disease from 6 months to 3 years (15.97 +/- 9.70 months). The activity of the inflammatory process and treatment efficacy were assessed by severity of the articular syndrome, duration of morning stiffness (DMS), pain and the disease activity (VAS), device examination, the disease activity by DAS28 indices, etc. The articular syndrome was assessed by the number of painful joints (NPJ), number of swollen joints (NSJ), etc. The functional status of the patient was evaluated by Keitel test, HAQ and hand grip. Calculations were made of erosive arthritis progression rate (EAPR) and joint fissure narrowing progression rate (FNPR). All the patients received leflunomide (100 mg/day for 3 days, then 20 mg/day). A 12-month course was finished by 14 patients, 4 patients were withdrawn because of side effects, the rest--by social causes. To the end of the trial leflunomide reduced NPJ by 84%, NSJ--by 95%, DMS--by 88%, articular pain by VAS--by 66%, the disease activity by VAS--by 70%. A positive trend in DAS28 criterium was observed (a significant suppression of RA activity after 1 month of therapy by 18%, after 4 months--by 39%, after 6 months--by 43%, by the end of the treatment--by 48%). For the initial 6 months EAPR was 0.50 +/- 0.67, for the following 6 months it lowered to 0.37 +/- 1.00, while FNPR decreased to 1.14 +/- 1.26 vs. 1.31 +/- 2 58 for initial 6 months. A positive change of the level of type 3 matrix metalloproteinase (a 20% and 16% by month 4 and to the end of the trial, respectively) was registered. A positive effect of leflunomide on RA inflammatory activity and progression rate of joint destruction was confirmed.

17013442	Comparative Study	To evaluate, using musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS), the effects of Etanercept therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) over 3 months of treatment. Eighteen consecutive patients, 3 male and 15 female, affected by RA (ACR criteria) who were non-responders or partial responders to DMARDs therapy were commenced on Etanercept treatment. MSUS was performed bilaterally in the 2nd and 5th metacarpophalangeal, 3rd interphalangeal, wrist and knee joints, using a Philips/HP Image Point HX machine with a 7,5 MHz linear probe for knee joints and a 14 MHz probe for the hands and wrists. In addition, power Doppler was used with the following settings: PRF 700-1000Hz, gain 60-65 dB, low filter. For all the changes a semi-quantitative score (0-3) was used to indicate the presence of a localised inflammatory process (synovitis, tenosynovitis). An overall score was then calculated based on the sum of the single scores in order to obtain a comprehensive score indicative of the global pathological change. The overall score significantly (p&lt;10-5) reduced between T0 (8,5) and T3 (5). Even the most part of the local joint scores significantly reduced. A positive response to treatment with Etanercept was demonstrated by MSUS examination of several joints. The results of our study are supportive of those presented in other reports where MSUS was used to monitor disease activity. We were able however to demonstrate this in a wider range of anatomical targets than in previous studies. MSUS is a useful tool in the monitoring of biologic therapy in RA.

7005521	Clinical Trial	A prospective clinical trial in couples was done to compare effectiveness and toxicity of gold and D-penicillamine (D-Pen.) in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (r.A.). Respecting defined criteria 70 patients were put to couples according to a random list and were treated with gold or D-Pen. alternatively. Physical and laboratory indices of inflammatory activity were checked every 3 months, X-rays every 12 months. Dropouts (side effects, missing compliance, uneffectiveness) were replaced by the nextcoming fitting patient. Thirty-two of 147 totally recruited patients stopped treatment because of side effects, three because of unsatisfying efficiency. Forty-two patients shuned the necessary controls. The clinical course was better in 16 couples with gold, only in sex couples with D-Pen. Thirteen pairs showed no difference in this respect (p = 0.05). Looking to the laboratory parameters separately D-Pen. tends to be superior (p &lt; 0.05), radiografic deterioration seems to be more seldom with gold (&lt; 0.05). Side effects occur with both drugs in comparable frequency (15/44 with D-Pen., 17/52 with gold), but the complications with D-Pen. are more serious. Altogether this trial shows gold superior to D-Pen. in the long-term treatment of r.A.

27988789	Journal Article	We performed a systematic review designed to characterize clinical phenotypes and outcomes in Indigenous populations with rheumatic disease to enhance the understanding of how rheumatic disease presents in Indigenous populations and allow for better projection of the healthcare needs of the communities affected. A systematic search was performed in medical (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL), Indigenous and conference abstract databases (to June 2015). Search terms for Indigenous populations were combined with terms for inflammatory arthritis conditions, connective tissue disorders, crystal arthritis and osteoarthritis. Studies were included if they reported on disease features, disease activity measures, or patient-reported outcomes in Canadian, American, Australian or New Zealand Indigenous populations. Data were extracted in duplicate, and a narrative summary was prepared. A total of 5269 titles and abstracts were reviewed, of which 504 underwent full-text review and 85 met inclusion criteria. Nearly all the studies described outcomes in the North American populations (n = 77), with only four studies from Australia and four studies from New Zealand. The majority of studies were in rheumatoid arthritis (n = 31) and systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 19). Indigenous patients with rheumatoid arthritis had higher disease activity and reported more significant impact on patient-reported outcomes and quality of life than non-Indigenous patients. Spondyloarthropathy features were described in North American populations, with most patients having advanced manifestations. In systemic lupus erythematosus, nephritis was more frequent in Indigenous populations. Gout and osteoarthritis were more severe in New Zealand Maori populations. The existing literature supports differences in disease phenotype and severity in Indigenous populations of Canada, America, Australia and New Zealand. We encourage investigators in this area of research to undertake contemporary studies that disentangle differences between phenotype and severity that are biologic in etiology or merely reflecting differences in access to care and that provide a longitudinal assessment of outcomes in more diverse populations.

17888215	Journal Article	Early optimized therapy of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) results in improved outcomes. The initiation of optimized therapy is hindered by the difficulty of early diagnosis and the limitations of current disease activity and therapeutic response assessment tools. Identifying patients requiring early combination DMARD/biologic therapy is currently a significant clinical challenge given the lack of definitive prognostic criteria. Since cytokines are soluble intracellular signaling molecules that modulate disease pathology in RA, we tested the recent conjecture that en mass serum cyto-kine measurement and monitoring will provide a useful tool for effective therapeutic management in RA. We assayed the levels of 16 serum cytokines in 18 RA patients treated prospectively with methotrexate and from 18 unaffected controls. Specific mechanistic aspects of inflammatory pathology in the periphery could be discerned on a patient-specific basis from patients\&#39; serum cytokine profiles, information that may aid in the design of anti-cytokine biologic therapy. A serum Cytokine Activity Index (CAI) was also created using multi-variant analysis methods. Distinct cytokines were significantly elevated in RA patients relative to controls, and three distinct clusters with correlations to disease activity were identified. The Cytokine Activity Index correlated well with the therapeutic res-ponse; responders and non-responders in this cohort were distinguishable as early as one month post initiation of methotrexate therapy, well before clinical assessments of response are commonly completed. Clinical assessment tools could be derived from this approach that may provide a means to continually track patients, allowing intervention strategies to be better evaluated on a patient-specific basis and to identify residual cytokine activity that could be used to guide combination therapy.

26634252	Journal Article	Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe and potentially lethal complication of several inflammatory diseases but seems particularly linked to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Standardized diagnostic and treatment guidelines for MAS in sJIA are currently lacking. The aim of this systematic literature review was to evaluate currently available literature on diagnostic criteria for MAS in sJIA and provide an overview of possible biomarkers for diagnosis, disease activity and treatment response and recent advances in treatment. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane. 495 papers were identified. Potentially relevant papers were selected by 3 authors after which full text screening was performed. All selected papers were evaluated by at least two independent experts for validity and level of evidence according to EULAR guidelines. 27 papers were included: 7 on diagnosis, 9 on biomarkers and 11 on treatment. Systematic review of the literature confirmed that there are no validated diagnostic criteria for MAS in sJIA. The preliminary Ravelli criteria, with the addition of ferritin, performed well in a large retrospective case-control study. Recently, an international consortium lead by PRINTO proposed a new set of diagnostic criteria able to distinguish MAS from active sJIA and/or infection with superior performance. Other promising diagnostic biomarkers potentially distinguish MAS complicating sJIA from primary and virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The highest level of evidence for treatment comes from case-series. High dose corticosteroids with or without cyclosporine A were frequently reported as first-line therapy. From the newer treatment modalities, promising responses have been reported with anakinra. MAS in sJIA seems to be diagnosed best by the recently proposed PRINTO criteria, although prospective validation is needed. Novel promising biomarkers for sJIA related MAS are in need of prospective validation as well, and are not widely available yet. Currently, treatment of MAS in sJIA relies more on experience than evidence based medicine. Taking into account the severity of MAS and the scarcity of evidence, early expert consultation is recommended as soon as MAS is suspected.

23966806	Journal Article	The aim of the present study was to emphasize the collagen turnover in 2 of the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases by evaluating serum prolidase activity (SPA) in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 30 patients who met the modified New York Criteria for the classification of AS, 29 patients who met the 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria for the classification of RA, and 31 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Serum samples of the patients and the controls were collected and SPA was measured by a spectrophotometric method. The comparison of the SPA in these 3 groups was statistically examined. In both patient groups, the SPA was lower than in the control group. SPA in patients with AS was statistically significantly lower than in the control and RA groups (P &lt; 0.001/P = 0.002). No statistically significant difference was found between the RA and the control groups (P = 0.891). In conclusion, lower SPA is presumably associated with decreased collagen turnover and fibrosis, leading to decreased physical functions in both chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal diseases.

11908470	Comparative Study	Little is known about the periodontal status of patients with Sjögren\&#39;s Syndrome (SS), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of SS patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. 8 primary SS and 10 secondary SS patients were examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. All patients were diagnosed by the European Community Criteria. Control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. The comparison of clinical status was made in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. Microbiological assays of the subgingival dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (Periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (PA) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Streptococcus oralis). The occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. No significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary SS patients for the PA test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. No significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or secondary SS patients compared with that of control subjects. The results of the present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with SS do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

21155991	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease, with a clinical manifestation both systemic and in joints. It has been suggested that age at disease onset and/or patients\&#39; age have influence on disease activity and clinical outcome. The reasons for the different course of RA in older people are not known; however, the activation status of peripheral blood lymphocytes could be responsible. Our aim was to relate expression of activation markers in peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells of RA patients with patients\&#39; age and/or onset age and disease activity measured by DAS28. Seventy RA patients were included into the immunological study. Two separation criteria were performed: based on age of RA onset and on the biological age of patients. We examined different activation markers, CD69, CD25, CD95 and human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR), on the CD4(+) T cell surface. Division of RA patients in 10-year intervals at 40, 50 and 60 years revealed that RA patients with later disease onset were characterized by higher DAS28. This phenomenon was not limited to the division at 60 years of age but, surprisingly, the major differences were found for the 40-year onset division. Analysis of all four components of DAS28 revealed that disease activity in older disease onset was dependent on all components. Older-onset RA patients had a higher percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD4(+) CD95(+) T cells. Summarizing the major differences in DAS28 and activation status of CD4(+) T cells observed for onset of disease at 40 years seems to be the most informative about the immunological status of RA patients.

18945303	Journal Article	Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders for more than 50 years. Methotrexate is a standard systemic therapy for severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid supplementation has been advocated to limit the toxicity of methotrexate on blood cells, gastrointestinal tract and liver. However, there is still controversy regarding the usefulness of folic acid supplementation. We sought to assess the evidence for the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in patients treated with methotrexate for inflammatory diseases. We also investigated whether folic acid supplementation may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials in patients treated with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis with or without arthritis were included. Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and analysis were carried out by two independent researchers. We selected double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. Analysis was performed for each subgroup of side-effects: gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, haematological and hepatic. Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample of 648 patients. There were 257 patients in the placebo group, 198 patients treated with folic acid, and 193 patients treated with folinic acid. The statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of 35.8% of hepatic side-effects induced by methotrexate for patients with supplementation with folic or folinic acid (95% confidence interval -0.467 to -0.248). There was no statistical difference for mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal side-effects although there was a trend in favour of supplementation. The effect of supplementation on haematological side-effects could not be assessed accurately due to a low incidence of these events in the population studied. We were unable to analyse the effect of supplementation on the effectiveness of methotrexate, as markers of activity used in each study were not comparable. Supplementation with folic acid is an effective measure to reduce hepatic adverse effects associated with methotrexate treatment. There is no difference between folinic acid and folic acid, but the lower cost of the latter promotes its use.

28123118	Journal Article	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between two semi-quantitative Doppler US scoring systems (SQS), and the quantitative scoring (QS) of Doppler pixel count. Adult patients with RA and inadequate clinical response to anti-rheumatic therapy were examined with musculoskeletal US (MSUS). Dorsal MSUS of the wrists, MCP and MTP 2-5 were performed. MSUS images with sign of synovitis were collected and the QS was measured. Five assessors blinded to the QS evaluated the images independently, according to either SQS method. Association between QS and SQS was studied using correlations and multilevel models taking into account the clustering of ratings at the rater, patient and joint levels. Analysis of the 1190 ratings revealed a strong correlation (ρ = 0.89, P &lt; 0.0001) and significant associations (P &lt; 0.0001) between QS and SQS. Correlations between QS and SQS according to Szkudlarek et al. (ρ = 0.87, P &lt; 0.0001) or Hammer et al. (ρ = 0.91, P &lt; 0.0001) were similar. A total of 239 (20.1%) images were given a SQS grade that did not match that expected based on initial QS, using pre-defined cut-offs. Main explanations for discrepancies were different perceived region of interest (40.7%) and Doppler pixel count near cut-offs between SQS grades (32.3%). We showed that both SQS methods correlated well with QS to assess synovitis, but SQS methods are intrinsically limited when the Doppler pixel count is close to the cut-offs between the SQS grades. Analysis discrepancies between these methods may help further revision of criteria used to assess disease activity with MSUS in RA.

29961640	Comparative Study	Success of treatment withdrawal in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis who are in remission remains unknown. The ABILITY-3 study explored the ability to withdraw adalimumab treatment in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis who achieved sustained clinical remission after open-label treatment with adalimumab. ABILITY-3 was a multicentre, two-period study done in 107 sites in 20 countries. We enrolled adult patients (≥18 years) diagnosed with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, fulfilling Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society classification criteria but not the modified New York radiologic criterion, who had objective evidence of active inflammation, active disease, and inadequate response to at least two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Patients who achieved Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) inactive disease (&lt;1·3) with open-label adalimumab (40 mg subcutaneously every other week for 28 weeks) at weeks 16, 20, 24, and 28 were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system to 40-week, double-blind treatment with adalimumab (continuation) or placebo (withdrawal). The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who did not experience a flare (defined as ASDAS ≥2·1 at two consecutive visits) during the double-blind period. Patients who flared were rescued with open-label adalimumab. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01808118. Between June 27, 2013, and October 22, 2015, 673 patients were enrolled to the study. The trial completed on April 14, 2017. Of 673 enrolled patients, 305 (45%) achieved sustained remission and were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment (152 patients to adalimumab and 153 to placebo). A greater proportion of patients continuing adalimumab than those receiving placebo did not experience a flare (107 [70%] of 152 patients vs 72 [47%] of 153 patients; p&lt;0·0001) up to and including week 68. Among 673 patients receiving adalimumab at any time, 516 (77%) patients reported an adverse event and 28 (4%) experienced a serious adverse event. The most common adverse events in both the adalimumab and placebo groups were nasopharyngitis (25 [16%] vs 20 [13%]), upper respiratory tract infection (20 [13%] vs 12 [8%]), and worsening of axial spondyloarthritis (ten [7%] vs 21 [14%]). In patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis who achieved sustained remission with adalimumab, continued therapy was associated with significantly fewer patients flaring than was treatment withdrawal.

17417995	Clinical Trial	TNF-alpha is thought to play a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of the chronic inflammatory process in rheumatoid arthritis. TNF-alpha blockers such as infliximab and etanercept are currently used in the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when traditional DMARDs have failed and are effective in a significant proportion of patients. However, about one third are non-responders to anti-TNF-alpha. The aim of this study was to verify whether rheumatoid patients, after failing infliximab, can benefit from etanercept. We analysed 18 patients with active RA with no response to at least 3 DMARDs and where infliximab therapy had failed. The patients had received infliximab associated with methotrexate: eleven of them did not show any significant response, while seven patients, after a good response, relapsed. Etanercept was then started. EULAR criteria of response were used with calculation of activity index DAS28 at baseline, after 2 weeks, 3 months and every third month until last follow-up. A moderate or good response was achieved with etanercept in 13 out of 18 patients. From our experience, etanercept can be considered as a good alternative choice when infliximab has failed.

22541617	Journal Article	The challenges of diagnosing rheumatic diseases are the high prevalence of certain rheumatic diseases, the existence of orphan disease, and the different pathophysiological backgrounds including infection and autoimmune mechanisms. During recent decades, more and more attention has been drawn to early diagnosis and achievement of full remission. Accordingly, new classification criteria have been developed and more biomarkers introduced into clinical practice. Specific laboratory parameters as well as wider use of functional imaging tools like ultrasound and magnetic resonance further support the early diagnostic process. Besides diagnosis early after disease onset, achievement of remission during follow-up is another important clinical aim of rheumatologists. In parallel with the development of new therapeutic approaches, both quality of life and treatment outcome especially of chronic inflammatory diseases could be improved. Both specific outcome parameters and global disease activity assessments are important to verify treatment goals of (full) remission, and at the same time may also predict response to treatment regimens.

17326817	Comparative Study	Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease, associated with an excess of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to accelerated atherosclerosis. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), the antibodies against oxLDL and the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) may play important roles in inflammation and atherosclerosis. We investigated the plasma levels of oxLDL and Lp-PLA2 activity as well as the autoantibody titers against mildly oxLDL in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA). The long-term effects of immunointervention on these parameters in patients with active disease were also determined. Fifty-eight ERA patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria were included in the study. Patients were treated with methotrexate and prednisone. Sixty-three apparently healthy volunteers also participated in the study and served as controls. Three different types of mildly oxLDL were prepared at the end of the lag, propagation and decomposition phases of oxidation. The serum autoantibody titers of the IgG type against all types of oxLDL were determined by an ELISA method. The plasma levels of oxLDL and the Lp-PLA2 activity were determined by an ELISA method and by the trichloroacetic acid precipitation procedure, respectively. At baseline, ERA patients exhibited elevated autoantibody titers against all types of mildly oxLDL as well as low activity of the total plasma Lp-PLA2 and the Lp-PLA2 associated with the high-density lipoprotein, compared with controls. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the elevated autoantibody titers towards oxLDL at the end of the decomposition phase of oxidation and the low plasma Lp-PLA2 activity are independently associated with ERA. After immunointervention autoantibody titers against all types of oxLDL were decreased in parallel to the increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein-Lp-PLA2 activity. We conclude that elevated autoantibody titers against oxLDL at the end of the decomposition phase of oxidation and low plasma Lp-PLA2 activity are feature characteristics of patients with ERA, suggesting an important role of these parameters in the pathophysiology of ERA as well as in the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in these patients.

12905466	Journal Article	To generate a molecular description of synovial tissue from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients that would allow us to unravel novel aspects of pathogenesis and to identify different forms of disease. We applied complementary DNA microarray analysis to profile gene expression, with a focus on immune-related genes, in affected joint tissues from RA patients and in tissues from osteoarthritis (OA) patients as a control. To validate microarray data, real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed on genes of interest. The gene expression signatures of synovial tissues from RA patients showed considerable variability, resulting in the identification of at least two molecularly distinct forms of RA tissues. One class of tissues revealed abundant expression of clusters of genes indicative of an involvement of the adaptive immune response. Detailed analysis of the expression profile provided evidence for a prominent role of an activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 pathway in these tissues. The expression profiles of another group of RA tissues revealed an increased tissue remodeling activity and a low inflammatory gene expression signature. The gene expression pattern in the latter tissues was reminiscent of that observed in the majority of OA tissues. The differences in the gene expression profiles provide a unique perspective for distinguishing different pathogenetic RA subsets based on molecular criteria. These data reflect important aspects of molecular variation that are relevant for understanding the biologic dysregulation underlying these subsets of RA. This approach may also help to define homogeneous groups for clinical studies and evaluation of targeted therapies.

29174881	Journal Article	Patients treated with the TNF antagonist adalimumab develop anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA), the prevalence of which varies depending on the assay used. Most assays are compromised due to the presence of adalimumab in the clinical samples. Our objective was to develop an antibody assay, applicable for clinical testing, which overcomes the limitation of therapeutic interference and to further determine the relationship between ATA development, adalimumab levels and disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Use of an electrochemiluminescence platform permitted development of fit-for-purpose immunoassays. Serum samples from patients, taken prior to and at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, were retrospectively analysed for levels of adalimumab and ATA. Overall, the antibody prevalence was 43.6% at 12 weeks and 41% at 24 weeks of treatment. Disruption of immune complexes by acid dissociation, a strategy often adopted for this purpose, only marginally increased the antibody prevalence to 48.7% and 46% at 12 and 24 weeks respectively. We found that antibody formation was associated with decreasing levels of circulating adalimumab, but no direct effect on disease activity was evident as assessed using DAS28 for RA patients and BASDAI for PsA and AS patients. However, a negative correlation of free adalimumab trough levels with disease activity scores was observed. Data showed that adalimumab levels can serve as an indicator of ATA development which can then be confirmed by ATA testing. Monitoring of both therapeutic and antibodies should be considered during adalimumab therapy to allow clinicians to personalise treatments for maximal therapeutic outcomes.

11037895	Clinical Trial	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of diacerein, a drug with interleukin-1beta--inhibitory activity in vitro, in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A total of 484 patients fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for knee OA were enrolled in this 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study group with 3 diacerein dosages of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day, and 150 mg/day (administered twice daily). In the intent-to-treat population, 100 mg/day diacerein (50 mg twice daily) was significantly superior (P &lt; 0.05) to placebo using the primary criterion (visual analog scale [VAS] assessment of pain on movement). Significant improvement (P &lt; 0.05) was also observed for the secondary criteria, which included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities OA Index (WOMAC), the WOMAC subscores, and the VAS assessment of handicap. In patients treated with diacerein dosages of 50 mg/day and 150 mg/day, favorable but not significant results were observed for the primary criterion. The best daily dosage of diacerein, calculated from the effect on the VAS assessment of pain on movement, was 90.1 mg. In the per-protocol population, the analysis of the primary criterion showed significant dose-dependent differences (P &lt; 0.05) between each of the 3 diacerein dosages and the placebo. No differences were observed among the 3 diacerein groups. A significantly higher incidence (P &lt; 0.05) of adverse events (AEs), as well as a higher rate of dropoout due to AEs, was observed in patients treated with 150 mg/day diacerein versus those treated with placebo, 50 mg/day diacerein, or 100 mg/day diacerein. Mild-to-moderate transient changes in bowel habits were the most frequent AEs, increasing with the dosage. Diacerein, a drug for the treatment of OA, was shown to be an effective treatment for symptoms in patients with knee OA. Taking into account both efficacy and safety, the optimal daily dosage of diacerein for patients with knee OA is 100 mg/day (50 mg twice daily).

17380231	Journal Article	To characterize articular and systemic inflammatory activity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), identifying remission status with and without medication. A total of 165 JIA cases, followed for a mean period of 3.6 years, were reviewed in order to characterize episodes of inactivity and clinical remission on and off medication. The resulting data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, survival analysis, by comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank testing and binary logistic regression analysis in order to identify predictive factors for remission or persistent activity. One hundred and eight of the cases reviewed fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 57 patients (52.7%) exhibited a total of 71 episodes of inactivity, with a mean of 2.9 years per episode; 36 inactivity episodes (50.7%) resulted in clinical remission off medication, 35% of which were of the persistent oligoarticular subtype. The probability of clinical remission on medication over 2 years was 81, 82, 97 and 83% for cases of persistent oligoarticular, extended oligoarticular, polyarticular and systemic JIA, respectively. The probability of clinical remission off medication 5 years after onset of remission was 40 and 67% for patients with persistent oligoarticular and systemic JIA, respectively. Persistent disease activity was significantly associated with the use of an anti-rheumatic drug combination. Age at JIA onset was the only factor that predicted clinical remission (p = 0.002). In this cohort, the probability of JIA progressing to clinical remission was greater for the persistent oligoarticular and systemic subtypes, when compared with polyarticular cases.

11548224	Clinical Trial	Glucosamine sulfate is a drug used for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), based on its pharmacological and metabolic activities on the cartilage and chondrocytes, complemented by mild anti-inflammatory properties and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. The aim of this study was to define the activity and safety of glucosamine sulfate on the symptoms of patients with OA, using a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study design. The study included 252 outpatients with OA of the knee (Lequesne\&#39;s criteria), radiological stage between I and III, and Lequesne\&#39;s severity index of at least 4 points and symptoms for at least 6 months. Patients were treated with either placebo or oral glucosamine sulfate 500 mg t.i.d. for 4 weeks, with weekly, with weekly clinic visits. Responders to treatment were defined as patients with a reduction of at least 3 points in the Lequesne\&#39;s index with a positive overall assessment by the investigator. The Lequesne\&#39;s index was 10.6 +/- 0.45 S.E.M. points in both groups at the start of the study. This decreased to 7.45 +/- 0.5 points in the treatment group (average 3.2) and 8.4 +/- 0.4 points in the placebo group (average 2.2) (P &lt; 0.05, Student\&#39;s t-test). The responder rate in the evaluable patients was 55% with glucosamine (N = 120) vs 38% with placebo (N = 121). These proportions were 52% vs 37% in an intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.014 and 0.016, respectively; Fisher\&#39;s Exact Test). The medications were well tolerated throughout the study, with no difference between the glucosamine and placebo treated groups. It is concluded that glucosamine sulfate may be a safe and effective symptomatic Slow Acting Drug for OA.

19453963	Clinical Trial	Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that is characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain and sensitivity to mechanical stimulation. In this pilot clinical trial, we tested the effectiveness of low-dose naltrexone in treating the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Participants completed a single-blind, crossover trial with the following time line: baseline (2 weeks), placebo (2 weeks), drug (8 weeks), and washout (2 weeks). Ten women meeting criteria for fibromyalgia and not taking an opioid medication. Naltrexone, in addition to antagonizing opioid receptors on neurons, also inhibits microglia activity in the central nervous system. At low doses (4.5 mg), naltrexone may inhibit the activity of microglia and reverse central and peripheral inflammation. Participants completed reports of symptom severity everyday, using a handheld computer. In addition, participants visited the lab every 2 weeks for tests of mechanical, heat, and cold pain sensitivity. Low-dose naltrexone reduced fibromyalgia symptoms in the entire cohort, with a greater than 30% reduction of symptoms over placebo. In addition, laboratory visits showed that mechanical and heat pain thresholds were improved by the drug. Side effects (including insomnia and vivid dreams) were rare, and described as minor and transient. Baseline erythrocyte sedimentation rate predicted over 80% of the variance in drug response. Individuals with higher sedimentation rates (indicating general inflammatory processes) had the greatest reduction of symptoms in response to low-dose naltrexone. We conclude that low-dose naltrexone may be an effective, highly tolerable, and inexpensive treatment for fibromyalgia.

19574472	Journal Article	To investigate a potential correlation between circulating cytokine and autoantibody levels and histopathological features in subgroups of patients with primary SS (pSS). Minor salivary gland biopsies from a cohort of 141 patients fulfilling the American-European consensus classification criteria for pSS were re-examined and grouped according to focus score (FS) and germinal centre (GC) status; serum samples were analysed for autoantibodies, chemokines and cytokines. Of the 115 available biopsies, 18 (16%) lacked characteristic focal mononuclear cell infiltrates [FS &lt; 1 (FS-)] but patients were positive for Ro/SSA and/or La/SSB. IL-17, IL-1RA, IL-15, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, eotaxin, IFN-alpha and IL-4 levels were significantly increased in the 27 (23%) patients with ectopic GC formation (GC+) in the salivary glands compared with the GC- patients (n = 70). In addition, minor differences in cytokine levels were found when comparing age groups. Degenerative changes observed in the minor salivary glands of patients with pSS may represent \&#39;burned out\&#39; inflammation. The elevated levels of IL-4 found in these patients may influence the reduced salivary flow observed in GC+ patients. Increased titres of Th17-associated cytokines, IL-17, IL-1beta and the IL-23 subunit IL-12p40, may indicate a higher activity of these cells in GC+ patients. Differences in cytokine levels may be utilized when sub-grouping the SS patients into disease phases and may consequently have implications for treatment.

25779750	Clinical Trial, Phase II	To study the efficacy/safety of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, compared with placebo in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, apremilast 20 mg twice a day, or apremilast 30 mg twice a day. Patients whose swollen and tender joint counts had not improved by ≥20% were considered nonresponders at week 16 and were required to enter the protocol-defined early escape. At week 24, patients were transitioned in a blinded manner to receive apremilast 20 mg twice a day if they were initially randomized to receive placebo. Patients who were not initially randomized to receive placebo continued to receive their target apremilast dose. Patients were required to take a stable dose of MTX (7.5-25 mg/week) throughout the study. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in a subset of patients. A total of 237 patients who were receiving MTX therapy were randomized and received ≥1 dose of study medication. At week 16, similar proportions of patients receiving placebo (35%), apremilast 20 mg twice a day (28%), and apremilast 30 mg twice a day (34%) met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for 20% improvement in disease activity (the primary efficacy end point). In the MRI substudy, mean change from baseline in total joint damage scores according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scoring system was generally similar with either apremilast dose at week 16. At week 52, no trends were noted for clinical end points by treatment group. Both apremilast doses were generally well tolerated. Apremilast efficacy was not demonstrated in patients who had active RA despite stable MTX therapy.

20399897	Journal Article	Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible damage to joint structures, including loss of articular cartilage, inflammation of the synovial membrane, and alterations in the subchondral bone. Symptomatic slow-acting drugs for osteoarthritis have been proposed as treatment because of their excellent safety profile. This review summarizes some data relating to the mechanisms of action of chondroitin sulfate in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritic joint tissues. Peer-reviewed articles obtained using pre-defined search criteria and published in the PubMed database are summarized. In addition, a relevant in press paper is included. Chondroitin sulfate belongs to the group of glycosaminoglycans and is a major component of articular cartilage. The effect of chondroitin sulfate in patients with osteoarthritis is possibly the result of the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes by inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes and other factors that contribute to cartilage matrix damage and cause the death of these cells. Chondroitin sulfate was also shown to exert anti-inflammatory activity. In addition, it acts on osteoarthritic subchondral bone osteoblasts by modulating the osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand ratio in favor of reduced bone resorption. It is noteworthy to mention that a head-to-head comparison of the effects of chondroitin sulfate of different origins and levels of purity on human osteoarthritic cartilage revealed the existence of a disparity in effects. The positive effects of chondroitin sulfate on the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis are possibly due to its contribution to a proper balance between anabolism/catabolism in the articular tissues.

19538718	Journal Article	Early and intensive treatment is important to inducing remission and preventing joint damage in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. While intensive combination therapy (Disease Modifying Anti-rheumatic Drugs and/or biologicals) is the most effective, rheumatologists in daily clinical practice prefer to start with monotherapy methotrexate and bridging corticosteroids. Intensive treatment should be started as soon as the first symptoms manifest, but at this early stage, ACR criteria may not be fulfilled, and there is a danger of over-treatment. We will therefore determine which induction therapy is most effective in the very early stage of persistent arthritis. To overcome over-treatment and under-treatment, the intensity of induction therapy will be based on a prediction model that predicts patients\&#39; propensity for persistent arthritis. A multicenter stratified randomized single-blind controlled trial is currently being performed in patients 18 years or older with recent-onset arthritis. Eight hundred ten patients are being stratified according to the likelihood of their developing persistent arthritis. In patients with a high probability of persistent arthritis, we will study combination Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug therapy compared to monotherapy methotrexate. In patients with an intermediate probability of persistent arthritis, we will study Disease Modifying Antirheumatic Drug of various intensities. In patients with a low probability, we will study non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine and a single dose of corticosteroids. If disease activity is not sufficiently reduced, treatment will be adjusted according to a step-up protocol. If remission is achieved for at least six months, medication will be tapered off. Patients will be followed up every three months over two years. This is the first rheumatological study to base treatment in early arthritis on a prediction rule. Treatment will be stratified according to the probability of persistent arthritis, and different combinations of treatment per stratum will be evaluated. Treatment will be started early, and patients will not need to meet the ACR-criteria for rheumatoid arthritis. This trial has been registered in Current Controlled Trials with the ISRCTN26791028.

21283321	English Abstract	Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon can be idiopathic (Raynaud\&#39;s disease) and is found in healthy individuals or secondary to various conditions. Our perception of Raynaud\&#39;s phenomenon has made a clear progression, partly due to a more useful set of diagnostic criteria for those rheumatic inflammatory diseases which are autoimmune. When it is unilateral, a vascular cause is generally found. When it is bilateral, there is usually an association with a systemic disorder. Laboratory investigation should be undertaken only if the physical findings suggest it. The etiology of Raynaud\&#39;s disease remains unknown. Medications proposed for its treatment are aimed at suppressing adrenergic neuronal activity of the sympathetic nervous system (reserpine, guanethidine, methyldopa) or suppressing alpha receptor activity (phenoxybenzamine, prazosin) or stimulating beta receptor activity (isoxsuprine, terbutaline).

15660235	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which cytokines play an important role. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the -590 IL-4 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA and its association with disease activity and severity. We enrolled 94 patients with RA diagnosed according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for analysis of the polymorphism at position -590 of the promoter of the IL-4 gene. The distribution of IL-4 genotypes in RA patients did not differ from control subjects. Nevertheless, the active form of RA was more frequently diagnosed in patients with T allele (genotypes CT and TT) as compared with homozygous CC patients. Moreover, in carriers of the T allele, parameters of disease activity (DAS 28 score, ESR, number of swollen and tender joints) were significantly increased. We suggest that the IL-4 -590 promoter polymorphism may be a genetic risk factor for RA severity.

9814091	Clinical Trial	The efficacy and safety of tenoxicam was compared to that of piroxicam in 48 Nigerian patients with Osteoarthritis of the knee or hips. Of these 31 females and 11 males, with a mean age of 52.5 +/- 11.0 years, were evaluated for comparable efficacy and tolerability. On fulfilling the selection criteria each patient was treated with either tenoxicam 20 mg or piroxicam 20 mg daily for six weeks. Efficacy was evaluated in terms of presence of pain (at rest, with mobility and after one day of normal activity), functional status and physicians global assessment of therapeutic efficacy. Tolerability was evaluated by incidence of adverse events whilst safety was evaluated by measurement of haematological and biochemical profile pre and post therapy. Thirty seven patients had been on previous medication before being switched over to trial drug. There was a dose change in three patients in the piroxicam group due to inefficacy. Also there was loss of efficacy during maintenance in one patient in the piroxicam group. Clinical efficacy was judged excellent or good in 82.3% of patients with tenoxicam and 76.0% with piroxicam. Tolerability was excellent or good in 88.2% of patients with tenoxicam and 60.0% with piroxicam. The incidence of adverse event was 15.8% with tenoxicam and 21.7% with piroxicam. Overall, when judged on various evaluation parameters, tenoxicam 20 mg/day appears to be more effective and better tolerated than piroxicam 20 mg/day, though these differences were not statistically significant.

26626632	Journal Article	The impact of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in periodontal diseases is controversial probably due to gender and age heterogeneity. We therefore evaluated a homogeneous female post-pubertal JIA population for these conditions. Thirty-five JIA patients and 35 gender/age comparable healthy controls were evaluated according to demographic data, complete periodontal evaluation, fasting lipoproteins, and anti-lipoprotein lipase antibodies. JIA scores, laboratorial tests, X-rays, and treatment were also assessed. Current age was similar in JIA patients and controls (11.90 ± 2.0 vs. 12.50 ± 3.0 years, p = 0.289). Complete periodontal assessments revealed that gingival index, dental plaque, gingival bleeding, and clinical dental attachment indices were alike in JIA patients and controls (p &gt; 0.05), except for gingival enlargement in former group (p &lt; 0.0001). Further analysis of patients with and without gingivitis revealed that cyclosporine use was more often observed in JIA patients with gingivitis (37 vs. 0%, p = 0.01), whereas no differences were evidenced in demographic, JIA scores, inflammatory markers, and lipid profile in both groups. Of note, two parameters of periodontal assessment were correlated with JIA scores [gingival index (GI) and Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) (r s  = +0.402, p = 0.020)] and plaque index (PI) and visual analog scale (VAS) physician (r s  = +0.430, p = 0.013). In addition, evaluation of dental assessment demonstrated that JIA activity scores had positive correlation with decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMF-T) and junvenile athritis disease activity score (JADAS) (r s  = +0.364,p = 0.037), VAS physician (r s  = +0.401,p = 0.021) and VAS patient (r s  = +0.364,p = 0.037). We demonstrated, using rigorous criteria, that periodontal and dental condition in JIA is similar to controls. In spite of that, the finding of a correlation with disease parameters provides additional evidence that increased activity and reduced functional ability underlies the deleterious effect of JIA in oral health.

20853196	Journal Article	The progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is quite variable, ranging from very mild or subclinical forms (approx. 10%) to rapidly progressing and debilitating forms (10-15%). The majority of patients present with an intermediate stage with episodes of exacerbation separated by periods of relative inactivity, which evolves to progressive functional losses. To optimise the therapeutic management of early RA it is necessary to perform periodic evaluations of the clinical and laboratory test responses to the treatment instituted, as well as the parameters indicating disease prognosis. Composite measures are frequently used to evaluate the disease activity score (DAS), including the response criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the response criteria and the DAS according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the composite indices of disease activity (CIDsA): DAS, the index of disease activity based on 28 joints (DAS 28), the simplified disease activity index (SDAI) and the clinical disease activity index (CDAI). The evaluation of prognosis includes investigation of the absence or occurrence of disease and joint damage remission. Due to the multifaceted nature of RA, no single clinical or laboratory parameter is able to describe satisfactorily the level of inflammatory activity or the disease prognosis at any given time.

20020138	Journal Article	Adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder characterised by high spiking fever, an evanescent salmon pink rash and arthritis, frequently accompanied by sore throat, myalgias, lymphadenopathies, splenomegaly and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Aetiology is still unknown, however, it seems that an important role is played by various infectious agents, which would act as triggers in genetically predisposed hosts. Diagnosis is a clinical one and may be lengthy because it requires exclusion of infectious neoplasms, including malignant lymphomas and leukaemias, and other autoimmune diseases. Different diagnostic or classification criteria have been proposed, but not definitely accepted. There are no specific laboratory tests for AOSD, but they reflect the systemic inflammation: the ESR is consistently high, while the rheumatoid factors and antinuclear antibodies are negative. High serum ferritin levels associated with a low fraction of its glycosylated component are assessed as useful diagnostic and disease activity markers. The clinical course can be divided into three main patterns with different prognoses: self-limited or monophasic, intermittent or polycyclic systemic and chronic articular pattern. Therapy includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs: biological agents have recently been introduced and they seem to be very promising not only for the treatment but also for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the disease.

17235556	Clinical Trial	Methotrexate (MTX) is a first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Leflunomide (LEF) and the biologic agents entered the arsenal of DMARDs in 1998. Therapeutic properties of new drugs are still under survey. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of MTX, LEF and a biologic agent (TNF-alpha blocker) combined with MTX in reducing disease activity in RA. Seventy-eight patients with active RA underwent a 24-week treatment with MTX 15 mg/week (30 pts), LEF 20 mg/day (30 pts) or a TNF-alpha blocker (etanercept 25 mg 2x weekly or infliximab 3 mg/kg in the week 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter) plus MTX 15 mg/week (18 pts). Only patients with RA resistant to MTX were included in groups receiving LEF or a biologic agent. During follow-up, patients\&#39; characteristics, disease characteristics, and clinical and laboratory data were registered. RA activity was evaluated using the ESR, tender and swollen joint counts, the duration of morning stiffness, disease activity score-28 (DAS 28), visual analogue scale (VAS) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). Treatment efficacy was demonstrated with ACR 20, 50 and 70 criteria. All groups revealed statistically significant improvement in all disease activity parameters measured. The percentage improvements were similar in groups treated with MTX and LEF and--except for VAS--significantly greater in the group treated with a biologic agent. Disease activity assessed by DAS 28 decreased significantly in all groups: the results were comparable in groups treated with MTX and LEF and significantly more prominent in the group treated with a TNF-alpha blocker. The ACR 20, 50 and 70 improvements amounted, respectively: 100, 50 and 7% in MTX group 87, 60 and 13% in LEF group and 100, 83 and 50% in a biologic agent group. The study revealed equal effectiveness of MTX and LEF in reducing disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. The efficacy of a TNF-alpha blocker combined with MTX was higher than that of each conventional DMARDs, especially with regard to ACR 70 criteria (considerable improvement after treatment). LEF was equally effective as MTX in patients unable to continue MTX treatment due to the drug\&#39;s ineffectiveness.

6395229	Clinical Trial	Rheumatologists must constantly ensure that the balance between the activity and the toxicity of slow acting antirheumatic drugs is always to the patient\&#39;s advantage. Trials must be continued long enough to permit evaluation of activity of these drugs. Double-blind testing with placebo provides information about the influence of a new compound on the natural course of the disease. Comparative studies determine the indications of new drugs and their place in the therapeutic arsenal of rheumatoid arthritis. Patients are selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, but the choice of the patient also plays a role. It is still impossible to divide a rheumatoid arthritis population into subgroups in which patients respond to this or that drug. The variability of the natural course of the disease makes it necessary to study large numbers of patients, thus making multicentre studies frequently necessary. The evaluation of disease activity is based principally on subjective measurements (morning stiffness, pain scale, joint counts); objective data are limited to grip strength and laboratory tests which often do not entirely correspond with the subjective variables. The occurrence of adverse reactions depends in great part on the way investigators\&#39; questions are formulated. Adverse reactions necessitating interruption of drug administration are particularly important. Withdrawals for inefficacy must be avoided as much as possible in double-blind trials with placebo.

8595932	Comparative Study	Blood polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) migratory activity was investigated in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and in healthy control subjects using fresh whole blood in a novel membrane filter assay. The PMNs migrated under FMLP stimulation and under blank control conditions (spontaneous migration). Essential evaluation criteria were the percentage of PMNs that migrated from the entire blood sample into the filters (TMI) and the penetration depth of the migrating cell bulk into the filters (DC). PMNs from healthy subjects penetrate deeper under FMLP stimulation than under blank control conditions. Migration depends on age and sex: the TMI decreases, while the DC and the reactivity towards FMLP increase with age. FMLP triggers a stronger DC reaction in females than in males. Compared with healthy subjects, patients with RA develop an increased PMN reaction, whereas FMLP inhibits migration in comparison with the blank controls. There is no correlation between disease activity estimated by joint functions and PMN migratory activity, while there are strong correlations between disease activity and the classical RA laboratory parameters WBC, platelets, BSR, CRP, hemoglobin and rheumatoid factor. PMNs therefore probably do not play a major role in joint injury. Gold therapy inhibits DC reactivity. PMN migration in RA differs markedly from the reactions in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, where high disease activity is associated with high PMN migratory activity, and the correlations between classical laboratory parameters and disease activity follow other patterns than in RA.

30077991	Journal Article	We aimed to determine the agreement between rheumatologist-judged inflammatory back pain (IBP) and criteria defining IBP in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and predictive value of IBP in identifying axial involvement in PsA. Using prospectively collected data, we investigated the agreement between rheumatologist judgement of IBP and IBP criteria (Calin, Rudwaleit and Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society) using the kappa coefficient. We also determined the sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios of the presence of back pain, rheumatologist-judged IBP and the three IBP criteria for detecting axial PsA (AxPsA). Finally, we compared the clinical and genetic markers in patients with PsA with axial radiological changes with and without back pain. 171 patients (52% male, mean age 46.6 years) were identified. Ninety-six (56.13%) patients reported chronic back pain. Sixty-five (38.01%) had IBP. 54 (32%) patients had evidence of radiological change in the spine. The agreement between rheumatologist judgement of IBP and IBP criteria was highest for the Calin criteria (0.70). Positive likelihood ratio for the presence of radiological axial involvement was highest for Rudwaleit criteria (2.17). No differences between patients with AxPsA with or without back pain were found, except for higher Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index and lower prevalence of human leucocyte antigen-B*38 in those with back pain. Rheumatologist-judged IBP or the criteria for IBP developed for ankylosing spondylitis may not perform well when ascertaining axial involvement in PsA.

22047935	Journal Article	The main aim of the thesis was to evaluate the impact of modern treatment strategies on disease activity and disease course in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to identify predictors for treatment response.   Two different treatment strategies were investigated: (A) Aggressive, conventional treatment aiming at achieving inflammatory control in patients with recent-onset RA and (B) Treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors in patients with RA, who had an incomplete response to conventional treatment. (A) was studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial (CIMESTRA), whereas (B) was investigated in an observational, nationwide cohort study (the DANBIO database).   The main findings were:    1. Treatment strategy (A) with methotrexate (MTX) and injections of glucocorticoids into swollen joints had rapid and sustained effect and reduced disease activity and halted joint damage. Addition of cyclosporine during the first 2 years reduced disease activity for as long as it was given, but had no effect on the development of joint damage. After 5 years, the majority of the patients was in remission and had no progression of structural joint damage.   2. Bone marrow oedema by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the wrists predicted the development of structural joint damage 2 to 5 years later (based on x-rays). Anti-CCP antibodies and structural joint damage at the start of treatment were also independent predictors for joint damage after 5 years.   3. Routine registration of adverse events observed in patients who received treatment with etanercept or infliximab (TNFα inhibitors) in the DANBIO database picked up twice as many serious adverse events than the spontaneous, mandatory reports to the Danish Medicines Agency.   4. Despite changes in prescription practice for the treatment with TNFα inhibitors in clinical practice from year 2000 to year 2005 towards less stringent treatment criteria, DANBIO data showed an improved treatment response.   5. High age, low functional status and concomitant treatment with prednisolone were negative predictors of a EULAR good response and remission after 6 months of treatment with TNFα inhibitors in clinical practice.   6. In patients, who were naïve to treatment with TNFα inhibitors, significant differences between drugs were observed regarding treatment responses and adherence to therapies. Infliximab had the lowest treatment response, remission rates and adherence to therapy. Adalimumab had the highest treatment response and remission rates, whereas etanercept had the highest adherence.   In conclusion, the results from the CIMESTRA trial and the DANBIO database showed that an aggressive treatment strategy with conventional drugs and intra-articular injections with betamethasone effectively controlled disease activity and prevent structural joint damage in patients with early RA. TNFα inhibitors were efficacious in clinical practice in the treatment of RA patients that had failed conventional treatment. Differences between the TNFα inhibitors regarding efficacy and drug adherence were found. Predictors of disease course and treatment response were identified.

22749821	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily involves the joints. Accurate and frequent assessment of RA disease activity is critical to optimal treatment planning. A novel algorithm has been developed to determine a multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score based upon measurement of the concentrations of 12 serum biomarkers in multiplex format. Biomarker assays from several different platforms were used in feasibility studies to identify biomarkers of potential significance. These assays were adapted to a multiplex platform for training and validation of the algorithm. In this study, the analytical performance of the underlying biomarker assays and the MBDA score was evaluated. Quantification of 12 biomarkers was performed with multiplexed sandwich immunoassays in three panels. Biomarker-specific capture antibodies were bound to specific locations in each well; detection antibodies were labeled with electrochemiluminescent tags. Data were acquired with a Sector Imager 6000, and analyte concentrations were determined. Parallelism, dynamic range, cross-reactivity, and precision were established for each biomarker as well as for the MBDA score. Interference by serum proteins, heterophilic antibodies, and common RA therapies was also assessed. The individual biomarker assays had 3-4 orders of magnitude dynamic ranges, with good reproducibility across time, operators, and reagent lots; the MBDA score had a median coefficient of variation of &lt;2% across the score range. Cross-reactivity as well as interference by serum rheumatoid factor (RF), human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), or common RA therapies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologics, was minimal. The same MBDA score was observed in different subjects despite having different biomarker profiles, supporting prior literature reports that multiple pathways contribute to RA.

24864133	Journal Article	To estimate endothelial dysfunction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) of short duration in relation to disease activity based on the assessment of 28 joints (DAS28). We studied 29 patients (22 women, mean age 41 (SD, 9) years) with RA of short duration and 29 healthy controls. The RA subjects were divided into those with low (DAS28: 2.6-5.1, n = 18) or high (DAS28 &gt; 5.1, n = 11) disease activity. Exclusion criteria included clinically overt atherosclerosis and other coexistent diseases. Biochemical markers of inflammatory activation and endothelial dysfunction were measured. There were no significant intergroup differences in the majority of classical cardiovascular risk factors. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor- α , and interleukin-6 were increased in RA subjects. Compared to the controls, levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, von Willebrand factor, and pentraxin-3 were significantly elevated in RA subjects with low disease activity, exhibiting no further significant rises in those with high disease activity. Asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine, soluble E-selectin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and osteoprotegerin were increased only in RA patients with high disease activity. Our findings might suggest a dissociation of pathways governing generalized and joint-specific inflammatory reactions from those involved in endothelial activation and inflammation within the vascular wall.

9621475	Case Reports	Rheumatoid arthritis is a common inflammatory articular disorder in Bangladesh. Methotrexate has proved to be an effective and relatively safe disease modifying drug for this disease. A quasiexperimental trial of the efficacy of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis was carried out in the Rheumatology Clinic, Institute of Postgraduate Medicine &amp; Research, Dhaka during the period between July 1992 and September 1993. Thirty eight patients fulfilling the revised ARA criteria were given methotrexate in a total weekly dose of 7.5 to 15 mg. They were followed up at weekly intervals for one month and then monthly for a total duration of six months. Twenty three subjects eventually completed the trial. The trial showed significant differences in the disease activity indices at the end of six months. The decline of activity was noted at the end of one month. As a whole the response was complete in 4(17%), marked in 14(61%), moderate in 4(17%) and nil in 1(4%). Adverse effects occurred in 27 subjects. They were mild and transient in 22.

24084414	Journal Article	One of the objectives of the Professional Practice Committee (PPC) of the Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) Section of the Union of European Medical Specialists (UEMS) is the development of the field of competence of PRM physicians in Europe. To achieve this objective, UEMS PRM Section PPC has adopted a systematic action plan of preparing a series of papers describing the role of PRM physicians in a number of disabling health conditions, based on the evidence of effectiveness of the physical and rehabilitation medicine interventions. Inflammatory arthritis is a major cause of disability with an important economic burden in society. The goals in the management of inflammatory arthritis are to control pain and disease activity, prevent joint damage, protect and enhance function and improve quality of life. This paper aims to define the role of PRM physicians in people with inflammatory arthritis. PRM interventions imply non-pharmacological treatments which include patient education for joint protection, energy conservation and self-management techniques, exercise therapy, physical modalities, orthoses/assistive devices and balneotherapy. Therapeutic patient education and exercises are the cornerstones of therapy with strong evidence of their effectiveness to improve function. Physical modalities are primarily used to decrease pain and stiffness whereas orthoses/assistive devices are usually prescribed to enhance activities and participation. PRM physicians have distinct roles in the management of people with inflammatory arthritis such that they effectively organise and supervise the PRM program in the context of interdisciplinary team work. Their role starts with a comprehensive assessment of patient\&#39;s functioning based on the International Classification of Functioning Disability and Health (ICF) as the framework. In the light of this assessment, appropriate PRM interventions individualised for the patient are administered. Future research and actions regarding the role of PRM in inflammatory arthritis should target access to care, updates on the use and effectiveness of physical modalities, orthoses/assistive devices, and standardization of therapeutic patient education programs.

15266544	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of the musculoskeletal system. The major goals of treatment are to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, slow down or stop joint damage, prevent disability, and preserve or improve the person\&#39;s sense of well-being and ability to function. Tai Chi, interchangeably known as Tai Chi Chuan, is an ancient Chinese health-promoting martial art form that has been recognized in China as an effective arthritis therapy for centuries. To assess the effectiveness and safety of Tai Chi as a treatment for people with RA. We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, Pedro and CINAHL databases up to September 2002, using the Cochrane Collaboration search strategy for randomised controlled trials. We also searched the Chinese Biomedical Database up to December 2003 and the Beijing Chinese Academy of Traditional Medicine up to December 2003. Randomized controlled trials and controlled clinical trials examining the benefits and harms of exercise programs with Tai Chi instruction or incorporating principles of Tai Chi philosophy were selected. We included control groups who received no therapy, sham therapy or another type of therapy. Two reviewers determined the studies to be included in this review, rated the methodological quality and extracted data using standardized forms. Four trials including 206 participants, were included in this review. Tai Chi-based exercise programs had no clinically important or statistically significant effect on most outcomes of disease activity, which included activities of daily living, tender and swollen joints and patient global overall rating. For range of motion, Tai Chi participants had statistically significant and clinically important improvements in ankle plantar flexion. No detrimental effects were found. One study found that compared to people who participated in traditional ROM exercise/rest programs those in a Tai Chi dance program reported a significantly higher level of participation in and enjoyment of exercise both immediately and four months after completion of the Tai Chi program. The results suggest Tai Chi does not exacerbate symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, Tai Chi has statistically significant benefits on lower extremity range of motion, in particular ankle range of motion, for people with RA. The included studies did not assess the effects on patient-reported pain.

24014495	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease, which is manifested as an inflammatory polyarthritis. Authors aimed to analyze the relationship between serum hepcidin, 25 amino acid protein, concentration and the anemia profiles of RA and to estimate whether it could reflect the disease activity of RA. Also, this study was conducted to explore the linkage between interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist gene (IL-1RN) polymorphism, proinflammatory cytokine, and RA. One hundred and eighty five RA patients were enrolled in the study. For all, the following criteria were measured: RA disease activities, anemia profiles, serum concentration of hepcidin using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and DNA samples were used to study genotypes of IL-1RN gene by polymerase chain reaction. Mean concentration of serum pro-hepcidin was (93.6 ± 31.5 ng/mL) in 185 RA patients. An increased frequency of the IL-1RN*1 and IL-1RN*2 alleles was relative to active RA (DAS28 &gt; 5.1) than those with inactive to moderate RA (DAS28 ≤ 5.1). Both hepcidin and IL-1RN gene showed significant correlation with each other as well with RA disease activity parameters and anemia profile. IL-1RN gene was significantly correlated with laboratory anemia profile apart from transferritin. There was a significant difference among pro-hepcidin concentration and IL-1RN frequency regarding patients with anemia of chronic disease and those without. In conclusion, both serum concentration of pro-hepcidin and IL-1RN genotypes frequency reflect the disease activity, regardless of the anemia states in RA patients, thus they may be another potential markers for disease activity of RA.

24938194	Journal Article	Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations involving virtually the entire body. The pain in SLE can have different causes. The SLE classification criteria include mainly the musculoskeletal manifestations of pain, which are commonly reported as initial symptoms of SLE, such as arthralgia, arthritis and/or myalgia. Chronic widespread pain, which is typical of fibromyalgia (FM), is frequently associated with SLE. The aim of this review is to describe widespread pain and fatigue in SLE, and the association of SLE and FM. Although secondary FM is not correlated with the disease activity, it may interfere with the daily activities of SLE patients. Therefore it is necessary to identify its symptoms and treat them promptly to improve the quality of life of patients. In conclusion, it is essential to identify the origin of pain in SLE in order to avoid dangerous over-treatment in patients with co-existing widespread pain and FM.

27117700	Clinical Trial, Phase I	To assess the safety of intra-articular (IA) autologous tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDC) in patients with inflammatory arthritis and an inflamed knee; to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the approach and to assess potential effects on local and systemic disease activities. An unblinded, randomised, controlled, dose escalation Phase I trial. TolDC were differentiated from CD14+ monocytes and loaded with autologous synovial fluid as a source of autoantigens. Cohorts of three participants received 1×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, 3×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or 10×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tolDC arthroscopically following saline irrigation of an inflamed (target) knee. Control participants received saline irrigation only. Primary outcome was flare of disease in the target knee within 5 days of treatment. Feasibility was assessed by successful tolDC manufacture and acceptability via patient questionnaire. Potential effects on disease activity were assessed by arthroscopic synovitis score, disease activity score (DAS)28 and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Immunomodulatory effects were sought in peripheral blood. There were no target knee flares within 5 days of treatment. At day 14, arthroscopic synovitis was present in all participants except for one who received 10×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tolDC; a further participant in this cohort declined day 14 arthroscopy because symptoms had remitted; both remained stable throughout 91 days of observation. There were no trends in DAS28 or HAQ score or consistent immunomodulatory effects in peripheral blood. 9 of 10 manufactured products met quality control release criteria; acceptability of the protocol by participants was high. IA tolDC therapy appears safe, feasible and acceptable. Knee symptoms stabilised in two patients who received 10×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; tolDC but no systemic clinical or immunomodulatory effects were detectable. NCT01352858.

27631530	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease. Due to the destruction of joints in the course of the disease it leads to significant morbidity in affected patients. The quality of life and even life expectancy can be severely impaired. Early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment is a decisive step towards a more benign course of the disease. New classification criteria have been published in order to help in early diagnosis. Methods of imaging, such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging help in the detection of synovitis, which is the major pathomorphological manifestation of arthritis and should be identified without any doubt. Treatment follows the rule of treat to target with the aim of achieving remission or if this is not realistic, at least the lowest possible level of disease activity. The first and perhaps most important step in therapy is the initiation of methotrexate or if contraindications are present, another disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) as soon as the diagnosis is made. Initial addition of glucocorticoids is recommended, which should be reduced in dose and terminated as soon as possible. Furthermore, either the combination of different DMARDs or the start of biologic DMARDs, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors or second generation biologic DMARDs is possible as a treatment option. The treatment follows the rule of shared decision-making and is the standard to treat comorbidities, the use an interdisciplinary approach and to treat functional deficits by rehabilitation measures, such as physiotherapy.

22073933	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects approximately 1% of the population. Initial symptoms include joint swelling, stiffness, and tenderness, which are all causes of disability. The diagnosis of RA is based on patient history of joint pain and stiffness, the documentation of symmetric polyarticular joint synovitis, and laboratory measures including radiographs, inflammatory markers, and autoantibodies. As the disease progresses, synovial inflammation leads to cartilage damage, bone erosions, and joint destruction, the major causes of long-term disability. RA is associated with many comorbidities and complications, including cardiovascular disease, which is responsible for higher rates of mortality among patients compared with the general population. Over the past 2 decades, advances in the development of synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents for RA have markedly changed treatment goals and management strategies. To review recent updates in the diagnosis and treatment of RA, as well as the importance of early and aggressive treatment and management strategies. Borrowing from other medical fields, a paradigm of \&quot;tight control\&quot; of RA has been supported by evidence and is gaining wide acceptance in rheumatology. In 2010, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published revised classification criteria for RA, which will assist in the diagnosis of early RA and facilitate appropriate treatment intervention. Over the last decade, many patients on biologic agents have demonstrated that early and aggressive treatment of RA is beneficial in treating synovial inflammation, delaying joint damage, and improving patient outcomes. Contemporary management strategies based on early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and regular monitoring have helped a significant number of patients with RA achieve current treatment goals of low levels of disease activity and, in some cases, clinical remission.

17596112	Journal Article	Naproxcinod is a derivative of naproxen with similar anti-inflammatory activity, but less gastrointestinal toxicity. It is the first of a new class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs known as cyclo-oxygenase-(COX)-inhibiting nitric oxide donators (CINODs) under development with NicOx in several countries. Naproxcinod is in phase III clinical development in the US for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The improved gastrointestinal tolerability of naproxcinod appears to be due to its release of nitric oxide (NO) and the consequent maintenance of tissue perfusion and integrity. Naproxcinod is available for licensing.AstraZeneca had been a worldwide licensee for naproxcinod and other CINODs. However, the results of phase II clinical trials of naproxcinod did not fulfill AstraZeneca\&#39;s strategic commercial criteria for further investment and NicOx reacquired rights following AstraZeneca\&#39;s decision to discontinue its involvement in 2003. NicOx was surprised by AstraZeneca\&#39;s decision, and remained fully convinced of the potential of naproxcinod. NicOx is seeking new partners for development of compounds of the CINOD class. The second phase III trial (302 study) for naproxcinod in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee was initiated in April 2007. The trial will enrol approximately 1020 patients from 120 clinical sites in the US. The study is designed to confirm naproxcinod\&#39;s efficacy and provide additional blood pressure data. Efficacy results are expected in mid-2008. The third phase III trial (303 study) is scheduled to start in the first half of 2007 and will assess the efficacy and safety in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Following pooled analysis of all three phase III trials, NicOx hopes to file an NDA in the US during the first quarter of 2009.NicOx is in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities worldwide regarding the safety of naproxcinod and its COX-inhibiting properties. The company submitted documentation to the US FDA in August 2006 that outlined the long-term safety assessments planned for naproxcinod and has requested scientific advice on naproxcinod from the EMEA in Europe. Pending successful outcomes of the three phase III trials in patients with OA, the company anticipates that regulatory submissions in the US and Europe could be made during Q1 2009. NicOx is planning to validate a proposed development plan for Japan with the Japanese authorities in Q1 2007. Another monitoring trial is being planned by NicOx: the 305 study is a clinical endoscopy study whose objective is to confirm previous clinical findings that treatment with naproxcinod results in less gastrointestinal damage than naproxen. The trial is expected to start in 2007. The STAR Multinational Study Group has conducted a phase II gastrointestinal safety and efficacy study of naproxcinod versus naproxen in 970 patients with osteoarthritis at 80 sites in Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, Mexico, Norway, Poland, South Africa and the UK. The study was completed in November 2002.Previously, AstraZeneca had conducted a randomised, phase II trial evaluating naproxcinod\&#39;s efficacy and safety among 672 subjects with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

21495300	English Abstract	Numerous studies demonstrate the high specificity (90-98%) of the anticyclic citrullinated antibodies (antiCCP) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their correlation with the erosive arthritis, these antibodies being a disease activity marker and a prognostic factor. A total of 53 RA patients (48 women, 5 men), mean age 47.3 years old, diagnosed according to the ACR criteria were evaluated. The clinical evaluation was centered upon: tender joint count, swollen joint count, patient pain (VAS), morning stiffness and disease activity score (DAS28). The laboratory tests had in view: the inflammatory syndrome, blood count, immunological syndrome (antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antiCCP antibodies), radiographs of the hands and feet. The high levels of the anti-CCP antibodies founded in 28 patients with RA were correlated with severity of the inflammatory syndrome, the immunological abnormalities and with the precocity appearance of the joint erosions. The presence of the anti-CCP antibodies at patients with RA are correlated with severe joint destruction and it represents a marker of the disease activity and progression.

14974882	English Abstract	Rheumatoid arthritis affects 0.5% of the Spanish population. It is a disabling, slowly progressive disease which primarily affects joints, and results in functional impairment and important quality of life reductions in most patients. Its etiology is presently unknown. Treatment is aimed at reducing inflammatory activity, preserving function, and delaying joint lesions, which result in high morbidity and mortality. Treatment is usually initiated with NSAIDs and glycocorticoids to relieve symptoms, and then followed by disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Recent advances in the understanding of etiopathogenic mechanisms have permitted the development of novel, much more specific treatments aimed at modifying disease progression. These include those acting on the tumoral necrosis factor (TNF) - etanercept and infliximab - and more recently an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist - anakinra. Despite their demonstrated improved tolerance and faster onset of action, their high cost warrants further efficacy studies and the establishment of objective criteria for their use.

17610317	Clinical Trial	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha has a prominent role in the inflammatory process and bone resorption in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We evaluated the markers of clinical efficacy and bone biochemical changes in Korean patients with AS treated with etanercept therapy. Serum samples from 26 patients receiving etanercept for refractory AS were obtained at baseline and 12 weeks after treatment. Clinical measures and serum levels of transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin, C-telopeptide (CTX), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were measured at each timepoint. Significant improvement of the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Functional Index (BASFI) was achieved after 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.001). ASsessments in Ankylosing Spondylitis Working Group (ASAS) 20 criteria were achieved by 22 patients (84.6%) after 12 weeks\&#39; treatment. ASAS 50 and 70 were achieved by 10 (38.5%) and 7 patients (26.9%). Serum levels of BALP and osteocalcin were significantly increased after 12 weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of CTX were not changed after treatment. Serum levels of TGF-Beta, MMP-3, and M-CSF were significantly decreased after 12 weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of OPG and RANKL were not changed. Change of MMP-3 had a high correlation coefficient with changes of C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) upon etanercept treatment (CRP, r = 0.446, p = 0.022; ESR, r = 0.449, p = 0.021). In patients with AS, etanercept therapy may be effective for reducing disease activity and improving bone biochemical markers. MMP-3 may be a useful biomarker for monitoring etanercept therapy.

19019888	Clinical Trial, Phase II	To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 5-year, long-term tocilizumab monotherapy for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In an open-label, long-term extension trial following an initial 3-month randomised phase II trial, 143 of the 163 patients who participated in the initial blinded study received tocilizumab monotherapy (8 mg/kg) every 4 weeks. Concomitant therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or oral prednisolone (10 mg daily maximum) was permitted. All patients were evaluated with American College of Rheumatology (ACR) improvement criteria, disease activity score (DAS) in 28 joints, and the European League Against Rheumatism response, as well as for safety issues. 143 patients were enrolled in the open-label, long-term extension trial and 94 (66%) patients had completed 5 years as of March 2007. 32 patients (22%) withdrew from the study due to adverse events and one patient (0.7%) due to unsatisfactory response. 14 patients withdrew because of the patient\&#39;s request or other reasons. The serious adverse event rate was 27.5 events per 100 patient-years, with 5.7 serious infections per 100 patient-years, based on a total tocilizumab exposure of 612 patient-years. Of the 88 patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline, 78 (88.6%) were able to decrease their corticosteroid dose and 28 (31.8%) discontinued corticosteroids. At 5 years, 79/94 (84.0%), 65/94 (69.1%) and 41/94 (43.6%) of the patients achieved ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 improvement criteria, respectively. Remission defined as DAS28 less than 2.6 was achieved in 52/94 (55.3%) of the patients. In this 5-year extension study, tocilizumab demonstrated sustained long-term efficacy and a generally good safety profile.

2084855	Comparative Study	Recently, the disease activity has been believed to be effectively controlled by remission inducing agents such as gold salt and D-penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis. However, there remain some doubts whether the prognosis of RA has been improved by these drugs or not. The frequency of complete remission in RA patients and their special features were studied to know the real state of the remission of RA under the present treatments. The subjects under investigation were 466 RA patients who were treated with remission-inducing agents for one to eight years. There were 90 male and 376 female patients diagnosed as definite or classical RA. Complete remission according to ARA criteria (Pinals R.S. et al. 1981) was noted in 33 (7.1%) of the 466 patients. However, relapse of the disease activity was observed in five patients during an observation period of two years on average. The followings were noted as the clinical and laboratory features of 26 cases with complete remission which could be observed for more than six months. A breakdown on sex revealed that the remission rate was 13.3% in male patients, compared to 5.6% in female patients. Duration of the disease for these complete remission cases was shorter for males than for females. Clinical examination of the cases with complete remission revealed that the most of them had no family history of RA, as well as no rheumatoid nodule or hip contracture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	NA	Ryumachi.

30874520	English Abstract	To study the prevalence of cognitive disorders (CD) and clinical/pathogenetic correlations of CD in patients with Behçet\&#39;s Disease (BD). One hundred and six BD patients were enrolled in the study. The majority of patients were natives of the North Caucasus (51.9%). Mean age was 33.3±0.98 years, mean illness duration 148.5±10.4 months. All the patients met the criteria of the International Study Group for BD (1990) classification. The disease activity was assessed by scoring system BDCAF. A diagnosis of a mental disorder (MD) was established by the psychiatrist in accordance with the ICD-10 using a semi-structured interview. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), a pathopsychological method \&#39;Pictograms\&#39;, clinical/psychological methods for assessment of cognitive functions (memory, attention concentration, logic thinking) were administered. Brain MRI was done in 44 (41.5%) BD patients. The study was conducted in the frames of the interdisciplinary program \&#39;Stress factors and mental disorders in immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases\&#39;. CD of mild to moderate severity were diagnosed in 82 (77.4%) and anxiety-depressive disorders in 81 (76.4%) of BD patients. The patients with CD were older compared to patients without cognitive disorders (34.3±1.07 vs 29.0±2.14, p=0.006). Patients with CD were most often (84.1% vs 50.0%, p=0.001) diagnosed with anxiety-depressive disorder (anxiety, chronic/recurrent depression). MADRS scores were higher (16.1±0.74 vs 12.2±1.06, p=0.005) though did not exceed the moderate level. The impact of chronic psychosocial stressors was detected more often in CD patients. MRI results showed that the frequency of chronic multifocal, predominantly subcortical, changes in the white matter was higher in CD patients. CD are characteristic of most patients with BD. They are associated with the age, anxiety-depressive disorders, chronic stressors and minor brain multifocal subcortical parenchymal MRI lesions.

25774061	Journal Article	Monocytes of children with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) show Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) overexpression. Tenascin-C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein and acts as an endogenous TLR4 ligand. Thus, we studied the serum and synovial fluid (SF) levels of TNC in children with ERA. TNC was measured in the serum of 80 children with ERA satisfying the International League of Associations for Rheumatology criteria. Fifteen children were followed up while being treated with regular nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy and levels were reassessed at 3 months. Seventeen paired serum-SF samples and 25 healthy control serum samples were also analyzed. Disease activity was assessed by physician\&#39;s global assessment (PGA), early morning stiffness (EMS), tender (TJC) and swollen joint counts (SJC), enthesitis score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The mean serum TNC level in patients with active disease (67.1 ± 44.9 ng/ml) was significantly higher than in those with inactive disease (40.6 ± 36.7 ng/ml, p = 0.01) and healthy controls (21 ± 15.2 ng/ml, p &lt; 0.001). Levels of TNC were higher in HLA-B27-positive (58.4 ng/ml) versus -negative disease (20.4 ng/ml, p = 0.01). TNC levels correlated moderately with disease activity: PGA r = 0.4, EMS r = 0.34, TJC r = 0.4, SJC r = 0.46, ESR r = 0.42, and CRP r = 0.32. In receiver-operation characteristic analysis for active versus inactive diseases, TNC [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.754] was equivalent to ESR (AUC = 0.787) and CRP (AUC = 0.789). Regular NSAID therapy led to a significant fall in serum TNC levels at 3 months (p = 0.0003). The SF TNC level was 17.39 ng/ml, significantly lower than the paired serum values (p = 0.01).

26576067	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by joint erosions, progressive focal bone loss, and chronic inflammation. 20 female patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis were treated with anti-TNF-antibody adalimumab in addition to concomitant antirheumatic therapies. Patients were assessed for overall disease activity using the DAS28 score, and neopterin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations as well as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and soluble receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (sRANKL) concentrations were determined before therapy and at week 12. Neopterin as well as OPG and sRANKL were determined by commercial ELISAs. Before anti-TNF therapy patients presented with high disease activity and elevated concentrations of circulating inflammatory markers. OPG concentrations correlated with neopterin (rs = 0.494, p = 0.027), but not with DAS28. OPG concentrations and disease activity scores declined during anti-TNF-treatment (both p &lt; 0.02). Patients who achieved remission (n = 7) or showed a good response according to EULAR criteria (n = 13) presented with initially higher baseline OPG levels, which subsequently decreased significantly during treatment (p = 0.018 for remission, p = 0.011 for good response). Adalimumab therapy was effective in modifying disease activity and reducing proinflammatory and bone remodelling cascades.

29102157	Journal Article	To assess validity, responsiveness and interpretability of the UltraSound-CLinical ARthritis Activity (US-CLARA) index in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this longitudinal study were involved RA patients starting treatment with abatacept. Subjects were followed along three visits in the first 6 months of therapy and underwent a comprehensive clinimetric evaluation. Validity was explored correlating the baseline scores and the cumulative inflammatory burden of the US-CLARA with the other composite indices applied. Sensitivity to change was assessed after 6 months of treatment in terms of internal and external responsiveness. Interpretability was defined in terms of determination of cutoffs against external criteria for remission (REM), low disease activity (LDA), moderate disease activity (MDA), and high disease activity (HDA) of SDAI. One-hundred and thirty patients completed the study. moderate correlations were observed between US-CLARA and both DAS28-CRP and DAS28-ESR. Higher correlations were also found between US-CLARA and both SDAI and CDAI scores. Responsiveness: internal responsiveness was wide, with SRM and ES ranging from 0.91 to 1.51. US-CLARA responsiveness was similar to that of DAS28, SDAI, or CDAI. Similarly, the area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC) of US-CLARA gives identical results. The AUC of cumulative inflammatory burden, calculated during the 6-months follow-up of all combinations were highly correlated (p &lt; 0.0001). Interpretability: cutoff values for REM, US-CLARA &lt;2.0; for LDA, 2.0 ≤US-CLARA &lt;3; for MDA, 3 ≤US-CLARA ≤4.8; for HDA, US-CLARA &gt;4.8. The US-CLARA is valid and sensitive tool to assess disease activity in RA.

23531873	Journal Article	There are many studies demonstrating deteriorated ventricle and endothelium functions in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. As FMF is an autoinflammatory disease with an ongoing inflammatory activity and inflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in some of the rheumatic diseases, we aimed to investigate the early markers of atherosclerosis in patients with FMF by the measurements of serum paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) activity, mean platelet volume (MPV) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level. This study is a cross-sectional, observational study. Forty consecutive patients with FMF and twenty healthy volunteers were selected to form the study population. The diagnosis of FMF was based on Tel-Hashomer criteria. Serum PON-1 activity, MPV and MDA level were determined to examine their association with FMF. Student\&#39;s t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. The mean PON-1 activity in FMF patients was significantly lower than in the healthy population (141.46±38.29 vs. 179.62±10.73 U/l, p&lt;0.01). Serum MDA levels were the same between the groups (1.08±0.66 vs. 1.08±0.33 nmol/mL, p=0.99). MPV was higher in FMF patients than in the control l group (8.87±0.99 vs. 8.22±0.45 fl, p=0.04). PON, MPV and MDA levels were the same in FMF patients with acute attack and attack -free period. Our results show that PON-1 activity is lower in patients with FMF. Reduced PON-1 activity and increased MPV, independent of the oxidative stress status of these patients, may lead to increased atherosclerotic propensity in FMF.

22956551	Journal Article	Anti-inflammatory therapies are effective analgesics for OA. This study determined whether low-dose oral prednisolone (PNL) was an effective analgesic for hand OA. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of people with ACR criteria hand OA and baseline hand pain visual analogue scale (VAS) of &gt;40/100 mm. Participants received 5 mg PNL or placebo daily for 4 weeks. Pain VAS, disease activity VAS, Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index and joint counts were performed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Primary outcome was the change in hand pain VAS at 4 weeks. Analysis of covariance was used for analysis, controlling for baseline values. To explore potential mechanism of action of PNL, non-contrast 0.2 Tesla MRI was performed on the most painful hand at baseline and 4 weeks. A total of 70 participants were recruited (57 women, mean age 61 years, mean baseline pain VAS 61.5 mm); 75% had more than one joint with definite MRI synovitis/effusion. At 4 weeks the adjusted mean reduction in pain VAS was 19.9 mm (PNL group) and 16.8 mm (placebo group) (P = 0.54). There were no statistically significant differences in VAS, Australian/Canadian Hand Osteoarthritis Index or joint counts between placebo and PNL groups at 4 or 12 weeks. A total of 20 participants in each group achieved an Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International response. Baseline synovitis/effusion did not predict response to treatment. This is the first randomized controlled trial of low-dose corticosteroid alone for painful hand OA, which demonstrated that short-term low-dose oral PNL is not an effective analgesic treatment for hand OA.

24561410	Comparative Study	Variability in treatment is linked to lower quality of care and higher costs. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease for which care and management may vary considerably among rheumatologists. The extent of this variability and its cost ramifications have not been widely studied. This prospective study evaluated the quality and variability in care and quantified the potential cost implications. We used Clinical Performance and Value® vignettes to measure the quality of RA care among community-based rheumatologists. Three online Clinical Performance and Value® vignettes--representing patients likely seen in practice with mild disease activity (case A), worsening disease activity (case B), and stable disease with a complicating comorbidity (case C)--were administered to each rheumatologist. Responses were scored against evidence-based criteria. Costs were computed using current (2011) Medicare pricing. Data were analyzed using t test and fixed-effects analysis of variance. One hundred eight board-certified rheumatologists (72% were male; mean age, 49.1 years) completed the study. Overall quality scores averaged 61.3%. Those employed by a health system or in a multispecialty practice were more likely to score higher. Highest combined scores for diagnosis and treatment were evident with case A (61.7%) and lowest with case C (46.7%). Up to 79% of rheumatologists ordered at least 1 laboratory test that was considered unnecessary by study protocol criteria, incurring a mean excess cost of $37.85 per physician per case. Up to 26.9% rheumatologists prescribed biologic agents that were not indicated based on American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines, resulting in additional costs of $2041 per patient per month. In this study, we observed a wide range of reported practice variability by rheumatologists in the management of RA. This included unnecessary testing and use of biologic agents that increased the costs of treatment. Opportunities for quality improvement and cost control exist in the management of RA.

9652499	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology characterized by symmetric, erosive synovitis and sometimes multisystem involvement. It affects 1% of the adult population and exhibits a chronic fluctuating course which may result in progressive joint destruction, deformity, disability and premature death. We review the literature data relative to the peculiar pathologic features of the disease shown by diagnostic imaging techniques. All our patients were classified according to the diagnostic criteria of the American Rheumatism Association (1987). Plain radiography remains the diagnostic technique of choice, but ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also used. Clinically articular involvement presents as pain, swelling, stiffness and motion impairment. The patients with positive rheumatoid factor are &gt; 70% likely to develop joint damage or erosions within 2 years of disease onset. Any joint can be involved, but the proximal interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand and the wrist are preferential sites, as well as the metatarsophalangeal joint of the foot, the knee and the joints of the shoulder, the ankle and the hip. Symmetry is the hallmark of joint involvement. The synovium of bursae and tendon sheaths is also affected. Soft tissue (subcutaneous nodules), muscles (weakness and atrophy) and vessels (vasculitis) may also be involved. Systemic involvement may result in Felty\&#39;s syndrome, metabolic bone disorders (i.e. osteoporosis), Sjögren syndrome and pleuropulmonary abnormalities (pleural effusion, fibrosing alveolitis, constrictive bronchiolitis). The earliest abnormalities consist in synovial proliferation, soft tissue swelling, and osteoporosis. At a slightly later stage, the inflamed synovial tissue (\&#39;pannus\&#39;) extends across the cartilage surface, leading to chondral erosions and small bone erosions at the joint margin (bare areas). Marginal and central erosions follow in advanced stages and finally fibrous ankylosis, joint deformities (subluxations and dislocations), fractures and fragmentations are typical findings of more advanced RA. RA is a frequent joint disorder with a characteristic radiographic picture. Joint involvement patterns are sufficiently common to permit accurate diagnosis, especially when fusiform soft tissue swelling, regional osteoporosis, marginal and central erosions and diffuse loss of interosseous space are present. Conventional radiography remains the standard imaging technique for joint studies in the patients with suspected RA. US is recommended to diagnose soft tissue involvement (joint effusion). CT is very useful for showing abnormal processes in complex joints (sacroiliac and temporomandibular joints and craniocervical junction) which are difficult to depict completely with conventional radiography. Magnetic resonance applications include the assessment of disease activity: in particular, this technique may be the only tool differentiating synovial fluid and inflammatory pannus.

17996906	Case Reports	Serial changes in the circulating and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine levels were assessed in a patient with Sjogren\&#39;s syndrome (SS)-associated meningoencephalomyelitis. A 16-yr-old girl diagnosed as having primary SS at 8 yr of age presented headache and vomiting. CSF studies revealed lymphocyte-dominant pleocytosis and high IgM index, but no evidence of infection. Disturbed consciousness and diffuse slow waves on electroencephalogram led to the diagnosis of SS-meningoencephalitis. The clinical condition subsided after a cycle of dexamethasone therapy, however, 2 months later urinary retention and paresthesia of the lower body developed. Craniospinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed extensive intraparenchymal lesions with high T2-weighted signal intensity adjacent to the posterior left horn of lateral ventricle of the brain and the longitudinal lesion from C5 to T10 of the spinal cord. High-dose methyl-prednisolone and subsequent tacrolimus therapy has effectively controlled the activity of SS-meningoencephalomyelitis. Monitoring of systemic and CSF cytokine levels during the course of illness revealed that CSF interleukin-6, but not interferon-gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were the sensitive indicator of disease activity. The unique cytokine profile, differing from those of infectious meningitis may be useful for predicting the central nervous system involvement in autoimmune disease.

11196521	Clinical Trial	To assess the efficacy and safety of chondroitin sulfate (CS) 1 g/day per os compared to placebo, in a double blind, randomized, parallel group study, with 3 months treatment followed by a 3 month posttreatment period, in patients with femorotibial osteoarthritis (OA). The main criterion was the functional handicap assessed by Lequesne\&#39;s algofunctional index (AFI). Secondary efficacy criteria were: self-assessed pain with activity and at rest, self-assessed impact of OA on daily living, patient and physician assessed overall change in patient state since the previous visit, and daily NSAID and analgesic consumption, all evaluated monthly. The main analysis was performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population at treatment endpoint compared to baseline (Day 0). The ITT efficacy data set comprised 130 patients (63 in CS group and 67 in placebo group). At treatment endpoint, the AFI showed greater but nonsignificant improvement in the CS than in the placebo group. Improvement became significant (p = 0.02) in the completer population (n = 114). In the ITT population, all variables tended towards greater improvement in the CS than the placebo group. In the completer population, pain at rest also significantly decreased in the CS group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.03), and, one month after treatment, CS had a significantly higher persistent effect than placebo on the AFI (p = 0.01), pain with activity (p = 0.001), physician assessed patient state (p = 0.05), and most other efficacy criteria. Adverse event rates did not differ significantly. We observed a trend towards efficacy of CS 1 g/day compared to placebo with good tolerability after 3 month treatment, and persistent efficacy one month posttreatment. Further investigations are required to confirm this trend.

12946237	Journal Article	One theory of immune regulation involves homeostasis between T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) activity. The Th1/Th2 hypothesis arose from 1986 research suggesting mouse T-helper cells expressed differing cytokine patterns. This hypothesis was adapted to human immunity, with Th1- and Th2-helper cells directing different immune response pathways. Th1 cells drive the type-1 pathway (\&quot;cellular immunity\&quot;) to fight viruses and other intracellular pathogens, eliminate cancerous cells, and stimulate delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions. Th2 cells drive the type-2 pathway (\&quot;humoral immunity\&quot;) and up-regulate antibody production to fight extracellular organisms; type 2 dominance is credited with tolerance of xenografts and of the fetus during pregnancy. Overactivation of either pattern can cause disease, and either pathway can down-regulate the other. But the hypothesis has major inconsistencies; human cytokine activities rarely fall into exclusive pro-Th1 or -Th2 patterns. The non-helper regulatory T cells, or the antigen-presenting cells (APC), likely influence immunity in a manner comparable to Th1 and Th2 cells. Many diseases previously classified as Th1 or Th2 dominant fail to meet the set criteria. Experimentally, Th1 polarization is readily transformed to Th2 dominance through depletion of intracellular glutathione, and vice versa. Mercury depletes glutathione and polarizes toward Th2 dominance. Several nutrients and hormones measurably influence Th1/Th2 balance, including plant sterols/sterolins, melatonin, probiotics, progesterone, and the minerals selenium and zinc. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) significantly benefit diverse inflammatory and autoimmune conditions without any specific Th1/Th2 effect. Th1/Th2-based immunotherapies, e.g., T-cell receptor (TCR) peptides and interleukin-4 (IL-4) injections, have produced mixed results to date.

16606651	Journal Article	To compare the efficacy and safety of etanercept and sulfasalazine, alone and in combination, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite sulfasalazine treatment. A double-blind, randomised study in adult patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite stable sulfasalazine (2-3 g/day) treatment. The primary end point was a 20% response by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria at 24 weeks. At baseline, the three treatment groups (sulfasalazine, n = 50; etanercept, n = 103; etanercept and sulfasalazine, n = 101) were comparable for demographic variables and disease activity. Lack of efficacy was the primary reason for discontinuation (sulfasalazine, n = 12; etanercept, n = 1; etanercept and sulfasalazine, n = 4; p&lt;0.001). Significantly more patients receiving etanercept, alone or in combination (74% for each), achieved ACR 20 responses at 24 weeks than those receiving sulfasalazine (28%; p&lt;0.01). Similarly, more patients in the etanercept groups achieved ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses than those in the sulfasalazine group (p&lt;0.01). In the groups receiving etanercept, significant differences in the ACR core components were observed by week 2 compared with those receiving sulfasalazine alone (p&lt;0.01). The incidences of several common adverse events (headache, nausea, asthenia) were lower with etanercept alone than with the combination (p&lt;0.05), but infections and injection site reactions were higher with etanercept alone (p&lt;0.05). The safety profiles of both etanercept treatment groups were comparable with previous experience of etanercept. For all efficacy variables assessed, etanercept alone or in combination with sulfasalazine resulted in substantial and similar improvement in disease activity from baseline to week 24 compared with sulfasalazine alone in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite their sulfasalazine treatment. All three treatments were generally well tolerated.

15763607	Clinical Trial	Lumiracoxib is a cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitor developed for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis, and acute pain. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of lumiracoxib 100 mg QD compared with celecoxib and placebo in patients with OA of the knee. In this 13-week, double-blind, double-dummy,placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients with primary OA of the knee and pain intensity in the target knee a 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale after a 3- to 7-day washout of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were randomized to receive lumiracoxib 100 mg QD, lumiracoxib 100 mg QD with a loading dose of lumiracoxib 200 mg QD for the first 2 weeks, celecoxib 200 mg QD, or placebo. Three primary efficacy variables were assessed at the end of the study: pain intensity in the target knee, the patient\&#39;s global assessment of disease activity, and functional status (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index total score). In addition, the treatment response was assessed using the Outcome Measures in Clinical Trials-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT OARSI) criteria. The safety profile and tolerability of all treatments were also examined. The study enrolled 1551 patients (primarily white; 62% female; mean age, 60.5 years): 391 were randomized to receive lumiracoxib 100 mg QD, 385 lumiracoxib 100 mg QD with a loading dose, 393 celecoxib 200 mg QD, and 382 placebo. Treatment groups were closely balanced at baseline with respect to demographic and disease characteristics. Lumiracoxib was superior to placebo (P &lt; 0.001) and similar to celecoxib on all primary efficacy variables. Reductions in pain intensity in the target knee were similar in the 2 lumiracoxib groups at week 13 (estimated least square mean difference vs placebo: -6.7 and -8.1 mm for lumiracoxib 100 mg QD and lumiracoxib 100 mg QD with loading dose, respectively; both, P &lt; 0.001); with celecoxib, the estimated least square mean difference was -5.7 mm (P &lt; 0.001). Significant differences compared with placebo were seen in all variables starting at week 2 for all active treatments (all, P &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were seen between the lumiracoxib groups at any time point. Based on OMERACT OARSI criteria, all active treatments were superior to placebo (all, P &lt; 0.001). Lumiracoxib and celecoxib were well tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events similar to that with placebo (64.7% lumiracoxib 100 mg QD, 67.0% lumiracoxib 100 mg QD with loading dose, 58.8% celecoxib, 58.4% placebo). In this population of patients with OA of the knee, lumiracoxib 100 mg QD was of similar efficacy to celecoxib 200 mg QD and had similar tolerability to placebo.

2595338	Journal Article	Between November 1984 and July 1988 a total of 8044 randomly selected German residents of the city of Hannover/FRG, aged 25 to 74, have been screened for rheumatic complaints by means of a postal questionnaire. An average 87% of the probands contacted returned completed questionnaires. Respondents with a \&quot;positive\&quot; questionnaire, i.e. suggestive of the existence of an inflammatory joint disease were invited for a rheumatological examination at the Hannover Medical School. 72% participated. 45 of a total of 1291 participants were identified as suffering from active or inactive, mostly rheumatoid arthritis. This yields a minimum prevalence of 0.56% (+/- 0.19%). The true prevalence is estimated to be 0.91% (99%-confidence interval 0.64-1.18). In 1985 and 1986 103 German RA sufferers aged 25 to 74, all citizens of Hannover, were referred to our outpatient rheumatology clinic for a first consultation. A comparison between the two groups revealed a higher disease activity in terms of \&quot;objective\&quot; criteria (joint swellings, ESR, rheumatoid factor) in the group of the referred patients as opposed to RA suffers from the community. Both groups were comparable in respect to \&quot;subjective\&quot; symptoms (morning stiffness, joint pain, pain intensity), functional capacity and degree of erosive joint lesions. The rheumatological outpatient clinic at the Hannover Medical School, providing the only specialized service in the region, actually covers less than 20% of all RA sufferers within the municipal area of Hannover and less than 50% of those with a \&quot;classical\&quot; RA according to the ARA-criteria.

3349944	Comparative Study	A retrospective analysis was undertaken of 31 patients with classical or proven chronic rheumatoid arthritis (CRA) who had been on a regimen of basic medication (gold salts, D-penicillamine, chloroquine, azathioprine--alone or in combination). Disease activity was checked by clinical, biochemical, immunological and radiological criteria. The laboratory results could not be altered by the basal medication and there was no relationship with the clinical and radiological findings, except for immunological results. None the less, the clinical symptoms improved under basal medication, even though the functional index got worse. The degree of joint destruction at the beginning and end of the observation period was markedly higher for seropositive than sero-negative cases, without significant differences in the rate of progression of joint destruction. Thus, definite long-term remission was achieved regarding the inflammatory changes but not the progressing joint destruction.

16219707	Journal Article	Adult onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown aetiology that is responsible for a significant proportion of cases of fever of unknown origin and can also have serious musculoskeletal sequelae. To assess and synthesise the evidence for optimal diagnosis and management of AOSD. The key terms, adult onset Still\&#39;s disease, AOSD, adult Still\&#39;s disease, ASD, Still\&#39;s disease were used to search Medline (1966-2005) and PubMed (1966-2005) for all available articles in the English language. Clinically relevant articles were subsequently selected. Bibliographies, textbooks, and websites of recent rheumatology conferences were also assessed. Data on diagnosis and treatment of AOSD are limited in the medical literature and consist mainly of case reports, small series, and modest scale retrospective studies. Diagnosis is clinical and requires exclusion of infectious, neoplastic, and other autoimmune diseases. Laboratory tests are non-specific and reflect heightened immunological activity. Treatment comprises non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs (methotrexate, leflunomide, gold, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, cyclophosphamide), and intravenous gammaglobulin. The recent successful application of biological agents (anti-tumour necrosis factor, anti-interleukin (IL)1, anti-IL6), often in combination with traditional immunosuppressive drugs, has been very promising. AOSD often poses a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge and clinical guidelines are lacking. The emergence of validated diagnostic criteria, discovery of better serological markers, and the application of new biological agents may all provide the clinician with significant tools for the diagnosis and management of this complex systemic disorder.

28073956	Journal Article	. RA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs). The objective was to estimate independent effects of RA autoantibodies on the incident CVEs in patients with early RA. Patients were enrolled in the Canadian Early Inflammatory Arthritis Cohort, a prospective multicentre inception cohort. Incident CVEs, including acute coronary syndromes and cerebrovascular events, were self-reported by the patient and partially validated by medical chart review. Seropositive status was defined as either RF or ACPA positive. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards survival analysis was used to estimate the effects of seropositive status on incident CVEs, controlling for RA clinical variables and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. . A total of 2626 patients were included: the mean symptom duration at diagnosis was 6.3 months ( s . d . 4.6), the mean age was 53 years ( s . d . 15), 72% were female and 86% met classification criteria for RA. Forty-six incident CVEs occurred over 6483 person-years [incidence rate 7.1/1000 person-years (95% confidence interval 5.3, 9.4)]. The CVE rate did not differ in seropositive vs seronegative subjects and seropositivity was not associated with incident CVEs in multivariable Cox regression models. Baseline covariates independently associated with incident CVEs were older age, a history of hypertension and a longer duration of RA symptoms prior to diagnosis. The rate of CVEs early in the course of inflammatory arthritis was low; however, delays in the diagnosis of arthritis increased the rate of CVEs. Hypertension was the strongest independent risk factor for CVEs. Results support early aggressive management of RA disease activity and co-morbidities to prevent severe complications.

19404945	Journal Article	To evaluate the evolution of functional and clinical outcomes over 11 years in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initially treated with a combination of 3 disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or with a single DMARD. A cohort of 199 patients with early active RA were initially randomized to receive treatment with a combination of methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine with prednisolone or treatment with a single DMARD (initially, sulfasalazine) with or without prednisolone. After 2 years, the drug treatment strategy became unrestricted, but still targeted remission. At 11 years, function was assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and clinical outcomes were assessed with the modified Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) measure and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for remission. At 11 years, 138 patients were assessed (68 in the combination-DMARD group and 70 in the single-DMARD group). The mean+/-SD HAQ scores were 0.34+/-0.54 in the combination-DMARD group and 0.38+/-0.58 in the single-DMARD group (P=0.88). Modified MDA was achieved by 63% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 51, 77) and by 43% (95% CI 32, 55) (P=0.016) of the combination-DMARD group and the single-DMARD group, respectively, and ACR remission by 37% (95% CI 26, 49) and by 19% (95% CI 11, 29) (P=0.017), respectively. Initial therapy with a combination of DMARDs in early RA results in higher rates of patients achieving modified MDA and strict ACR remission even over the long term than initial single-DMARD therapy. Targeting remission with tight clinical controls results in good functional and clinical outcomes in most RA patients.

28025555	Journal Article	Gallic acid (GA) and its derivatives are anti-inflammatory agents and are reported to have potent effects on Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted that the therapeutic effect and biocompatibility of GA is much weaker than its esters due to the high hydrophilicity. The therapeutic effect of GA on OA could be improved if certain structural modifications were made to increase its hydrophobicity. In this study, a novel sulfonamido-based gallate was synthesized by bonding sulfonamide with GA, and its biological evaluations on OA were investigated. Results show that 5-[4-(Pyrimidin-2-ylsulfamoylphenyl)]-carbamoyl-benzene-1,2,3-triyl triacetate (HAMDC) was able to reverse the effects induced by Interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation, and it also had a great effect on chondro-protection via promoting cell proliferation and maintaining the phenotype of articular chondrocytes, as well as enhancing synthesis of cartilage specific markers such as aggrecan, collagen II and Sox9. Furthermore, a docking study showed that HAMDC fits into the core of the active site of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5), which provides an explanation for its activity and selectivity.

26329342	Comparative Study	Anticitrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) is as sensitive as, but more specific than, rheumatoid factor (RF) and is detected earlier in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although part of the RA classification criteria, ACPA testing is not routinely paid for/accessible in all jurisdictions. The effect of missing ACPA testing was studied to determine whether failure to perform ACPA testing could cause a care gap in early inflammatory arthritis. Nearly 2000 patients (n = 1998) recruited to an early inflammatory arthritis cohort were allocated into 3 groups: (1) seropositive (either RF+ or ACPA+), (2) seronegative (RF- and ACPA-), and (3) missing ACPA and RF-. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, symptom duration, and smoking status if p &lt; 0.1. Disease Activity Score at 28 joints (DAS28) at 3 months was studied, because beyond then, disease activity is expected to determine ongoing treatment. More seropositive patients fulfilled the 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism RA criteria than seronegative patients. Group 3 was slightly older and had a smaller percentage of females, as well as shorter symptom duration and less smoking. At 3 months, group 3 was treated with fewer disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and methotrexate (p &lt; 0.00002) than groups 1 and 2, but there were no significant differences in DAS28, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI), proportion receiving corticosteroids, or physician\&#39;s/patient\&#39;s global assessments. There was no care gap in the RF-negative, unknown ACPA group because there were no significant differences in the DAS28, 3-month change in DAS28, or HAQ-DI, despite less treatment. Cost-effectiveness of ensuring ACPA testing availability in suspected RA is unknown because early outcomes did not differ, whether or not ACPA was available.

29784018	Case Reports	Adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) is a rare inflammatory disorder characterized by the classical triad of daily spiking fever, arthritis, and typical salmon-colored rash. Resistance to first-line corticosteroids and second-line disease modified anti-rheumatic-drugs defines refractory AOSD, which mostly includes the polycyclic or chronic courses of the disease. Anti-cytokine therapies are recommended in AOSD patients who are refractory to traditional treatments. This is the first report on the efficacy of colchicine in a patient with AOSD which was refractory to immunosuppressive treatments including biologics. A 24-years Japanese female patient was referred to our hospital for the flare-up of AOSD under the combined treatments with steroid, immunosuppressants, and biologics. She was diagnosed with AOSD according to the Yamaguchi criteria, based on the presence of spiking fever, polyarthralgia, skin rash, and hyperferritinemia. Interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor-α blockade treatments were not effective, the oral administration of colchicine was stared under the immunosuppressive treatments with steroid and cyclosporine A (CyA). Colchicine treatment silenced the disease activity of AOSD. The dose of prednisolone was successfully tapered, and the elevated levels of C-reactive protein were normalized. Remission has been maintained for 13 months with the start of oral administration of colchicine. We concluded that colchicine is an alternative treatment in patients with refractory AOSD, particularly in those with impaired therapeutic effects against anti-cytokines therapies.

1856802	Journal Article	We compared the benefits and risks of combinations of long acting antirheumatic drugs with those of the same drugs used singly in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We searched the literature through MEDLINE (1966-89), Index Medicus (1956-65), Excerpta Medica (1982-89), Science Citation Index (1982-89), and bibliographic review of located articles. Of a total of 341 citations, we identified 7 prospective trials that specifically addressed the stated purpose. We independently assessed the quality of the selected trials, using published methodological criteria and summarized the effect of treatment on arthritis activity and the incidence of side effects. The trials we evaluated tested various drug combinations. Because of deficiencies in methods and reporting, only 3 trials had sufficient quality to yield strong or moderately strong evidence. None conclusively demonstrated benefit of a drug combination: 2 suggested such benefit, including 1 also suggesting increased toxicity; the 3rd suggested only increased toxicity. The other 4 trials yielded weak evidence to support both increased efficacy and toxicity. The advantages of any antirheumatic drug combination remain unproven. Because these advantages are likely to be modest, they can only be shown in rigorously designed trials enrolling large numbers of patients. Methods and reporting of antirheumatic drug trials should be standardized to allow combining of study results.

21885514	Journal Article	In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), radiographic progression may occur despite clinical remission. This may be explained by subclinical inflammation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a greater sensitivity than clinical examination and radiography for assessing disease activity. Our objective was to determine the MRI characteristics of RA patients in clinical remission or low disease activity (LDA) state. Databases from 6 cohorts were collected from 5 international centers. RA patients in clinical remission according to Disease Activity Score28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP &lt; 2.6; n = 213) or LDA-state (2.6 ≤ DAS28-CRP &lt; 3.2; n = 81) with available MRI data were included. MRI were assessed according to the OMERACT RA MRI scoring system (RAMRIS).  70% women, median age 55 (interquartile range, IQR 43-63) years, disease duration 2.3 (IQR 0.7-5.1) years, DAS28-CRP 2.2 (IQR 1.8-2.6), Simplified Disease Activity Index, SDAI, 3.9 (IQR 1.9-6.5), Clinical Disease Activity Index, CDAI, 3.1 (IQR 1.5- 5.8), rheumatoid factor/anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide positivity 57%/54%, presence of radiographic erosions: 66%. Wrist and metacarpophalangeal MRI (MCP-MRI) data were available for 287 and 241 patients, respectively. MRI inflammatory activity in wrist and/or MCP joints was observed in the majority [synovitis: 95%, bone edema (osteitis): 35%] of patients. The median (IQR) RAMRIS score was 6 (3-9) for synovitis and 0 (0-2) for osteitis. Synovitis and osteitis were not less frequent in DAS28 clinical remission (synovitis/osteitis 96%/35%) than LDA (91/36). A trend towards lower frequencies of osteitis in patients in SDAI and CDAI remission was observed. Subclinical inflammation was identified by MRI in the majority of RA patients in clinical remission or LDA state. This may explain structural progression in such patients. Further work is required to understand the place of modern imaging in future remission criteria.

3688672	Journal Article	To assess whether weekly pulse methotrexate therapy alters radiographic progression of joint disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Prospective, controlled study. Hand, wrist and foot roentgenograms obtained before, at the onset of, and during methotrexate treatment were scored for degree of joint-space narrowing and erosions by three rheumatologists using a standard method. Sequential sample of 24 patients with active definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis and previous unsuccessful treatment; of these, 3 were excluded due to drug ineffectiveness; 2, due to side effects; and 1, due to refusal to take methotrexate. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone was continued. Methotrexate was given weekly to control clinical evidence of disease in patients. After having had an average of 30 months of therapy, the 18 patients who continued to receive methotrexate therapy showed significant (p less than 0.05) clinical improvement, as evidenced by their decreased joint counts and joint scores, duration of morning stiffness, pain scales, and sedimentation rates. Despite patients\&#39; prolonged clinical improvement, the mean rate of development of erosions and joint-space narrowing during methotrexate therapy was not significantly different from the rate of radiographic progression before methotrexate therapy (0.043 compared with 0.041; p greater than 0.05). Weekly pulse methotrexate is effective for the long-term management of clinical disease activity in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis but may not be a disease-modifying agent by roentgenographic criteria.

17345875	English Abstract	Amyloidosis refers to the extracellular deposition of proteinaceous insoluble fibrils in various tissues, resulting in organ compromise. The most common form of amyloidosis occurs secondary to chronic inflammatory disease, in which AA fibrils, derived from the acute phase protein, serum amyloid-A (SAA). We evaluated the prevalence of AA with lip biopsy on 106 rheumatoid arthritis patients (according to 1988 ARA criteria), asymptomaticwith regard to amyloidosis (90 females, 16 males). On histological salivary gland samples we evaluated the presence of AA by an immunohistochemical method [Anti Human Amiloid clone MC-1 (DAKO, Italy)]. We observed a positivity of AA on 8/106 patients (5 F/3 M) 7.54%. When the total data were divided into three groups considering the different lenght of the disease (number of years) we observed the following prevalence data: group A, years of disease &lt; 3, 2/45, 4.44% (F 1/M 1), group B, years of disease 3-5, 2/26, 7.69% (F 1/M 1), group C, years of disease &gt; 5, 4/35, 11.42%. The statistical analysis showed a significative difference between group A and B (p &lt; 0.025), between group B and C (p &lt; 0.025) and between group A and C (p &lt; 0.01). The 8 patients with AA positivity showed also an high disease activity in comparison with 98 negative patients: DAS 5.62 +/- 0.48 vs 4.36 +/- 0.79, DAS28 5.84 +/- 0.76 vs 4.48 +/- 0.87 (p &lt; 0.05). Our data showed that secondary AA amyloidosis prevalence in asymptomatic Italian rheumatoid arthritis patients was 7.54%; moreover this complication was present in 4.44% of early rheumatoid arthritis patients.

Forty-two postmenopausal women and men with knee OA according to American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria were included. Patients were randomized into isokinetic and aerobic exercises and control groups. In intervention groups, patients were included in predetermined exercise programs 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Severity of pain, functional activity status, muscle strength, functional capacity, and serum cytokine levels were evaluated at baseline and at the 6th week. At the end of 6th week, there was no statistically significant decrease in serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in both the exercise groups, although C-reactive protein levels exhibited a strong trend toward significance. We found a significant decrease in visual analog scale and Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index scores, and significant increase in functional capacity and muscle strength in both the exercise groups compared with those in the control group.

29975012	Journal Article	To study the prognostic value of widespread pain and of musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) examination for subsequent treatment outcomes in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). An exploratory prospective cohort study enrolled PsA patients initiating biologic/conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in routine care. Clinical-, US- and patient-reported measures were retrieved at baseline and after 4 months. Widespread non-arthritic pain (WP) was defined as Widespread Pain Index ≥4 with pain in ≥4/5 regions. PsA activity by US was defined as colour Doppler (CD) (yes/no) in selected entheses, joints or tendons. Main response criteria included American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20), Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis 50% (DAPSA50), and Minimal Disease Activity (MDA). The primary analyses were age-and gender adjusted logistic regression. WP was present in 24 (35%) of 69 included patients, and associated with worse patient-reported and composite baseline measures while US and other objective findings were similar to patients without WP. The odds of 4-months MDA were significantly greater for patients enrolled without WP (OR=18.43 [95% CI: 1.51-224.41], p=0.022), while WP did not impair other response measures. Patients with baseline CD activity (n=42 [61%]) had worse objective PsA burden but their chance of treatment response was comparable to those without CD. More than one-third of PsA patients presented with widespread non-arthritic pain, which was associated with worse patient-reported scores and failure to achieve MDA following cs/bDMARD therapy. PsA activity by colour Doppler ultrasound had no influence on subsequent treatment response in this PsA cohort. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

19581382	Journal Article	Early effective treatment slows structural damage in RA but requires an early diagnosis. Our objective was to determine symptoms duration and presentation patterns of RA at diagnosis in Senegal. We conducted a cross-sectional study over a 2-year period (from March 2006 to February 2008) at the rheumatology clinic of the Le Dantec teaching hospital in Dakar, Senegal. Consecutive new patients who met ACR criteria for RA were included. We included 100 patients, 88 females and 12 males, with a mean age of 40.3 +/- 15.5 years and a mean symptoms duration of 54 months. One-fourth of the patients had a positive family history. Pain was the main reason for the rheumatology clinic visit. Mean pain score was 64.3 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Nocturnal arousals were reported by 69% of the patients and morning stiffness for &gt;1 h by 74%. The tender and swollen joint counts were 10 or higher in 87% and 36% of the patients, respectively, and the mean disease activity score on 28 joints (DAS28) was 6.49 +/- 1.34. Sicca syndrome (n = 13) and rheumatoid nodules (n = 3) were the main extra-articular manifestations. Laboratory evidence of inflammation was found in 87% and RF in 78% of the patients. Antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCPs) were detected in 26 of the 29 patients. Radiographical lesions were visible in 56% of the patients; mean modified Sharp score was 21.76 +/- 47.74. The diagnosis of RA is delayed in Senegal, and the disease is highly active at diagnosis, although 44 patients have no erosions, and extra-articular manifestations are rare.

24398122	Journal Article	The aim of this study was to identify and characterize subclinical synovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in clinical remission using power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) and serum levels of biomarkers of inflammation and/or angiogenesis. We selected patients with RA in clinical remission defined as a Disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &lt;2.6 for more than six months tested by two independent rheumatologists. Clinical, epidemiological, demographic and serological data were analyzed. PDUS of knees and hands was performed by a sonographer. Synovial hypertrophy (SH) and PDUS signal were scored (grades 0 to 3). SH ≥2 and a PDUS signal was classified as active synovitis. Serum levels of biomarkers of inflammation/angiogenesis were determined by Quantibody Human Array. This study included 55 patients, of whom 25 (45.4%) met criteria for ultrasound-defined active synovitis. Patients with active synovitis had higher DAS28-C reactive protein (P = 0.023), DAS28-ESR (P = 0.06), simplified disease activity score, SDAI (P = 0.064), and only 12% were taking oral glucocorticoids (≤5 mg/day) compared with 40% of patients without active synovitis (P = 0.044). Patients with synovitis also had significantly higher serum levels of the angiogenic biomarkers angiopoietin-2 (P = 0.038), vascular endothelial growth factor-D (P = 0.018), placental growth factor (P = 0.043), stromal cell-derived factor-1 (P = 0.035), matrix metallopeptidase-2 (P = 0.027) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (P = 0.007), but not of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nearly half of the patients with RA in clinical remission had ultrasound-defined active synovitis, higher disease activity and less frequent oral glucocorticoid consumption than patients without active synovitis. This clinical situation was associated with a specific biological profile characterized by an excess of angiogenic mediators rather than persistent proinflammatory cytokine responses.

20426913	Journal Article	To make a comparison between the clinical data and the imaging results with 99mTc-nanocolloid scintigraphy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients considered to be in remission. Forty RA patients found to be in clinical remission according to the ACR and the EULAR (DAS28&lt;2.6) criteria were studied. The group included 29 females and 11 males with a mean age of 60.8+/-13.5 years (range 22-86) and a mean disease duration of 13.4+/-7.7 years (range 2-23). The mean time of remission in the study group was 22.2+/-5.2 months (range 11-36). Each patient was given an intravenous injection of 555MBq of 99mTc-nanocalloid (NC). Spot views of the skeleton were taken and a SPECT-CT was done on the wrists and hands. A scan was considered positive when at least one of the hand joints showed increased tracer uptake. The 99mTc-nanocalloid scintigraphy was negative in 14 (35%) and positive for active joint disease in 26 (65%) patients. Twenty four out of the 26 patients with positive scan (92%) were sero-positive while those who had a negative scintigraphy were all sero-negative except one. No correlation was found between the type of treatment used, the time that elapsed from remission, or laboratory parameters (ESR CRP) and the scintigraphic results. The clinical criteria used for remission in RA are not consistent with the actual inflammatory activity in the joints. These results are especially emphasised in the subgroup of sero-positive patients.

Sixty patients with the diagnosis of SLE verified by the 1997 American College of Rheumatology criteria and 30 apparently healthy individuals were followed up. The levels of Ab to catalase (Cat), xanthine oxidase (XO), and cardiolipin (CL) were measured by enzyme immunoassay, by applying the respective ANS as an antigenic matrix. There was a significant relationship of the levels of Ab to Cat and XO to the activity of SLE. It was shown that Ab to Cat and XO could affect the functional activity of serum enzymes. The level of Ab to CL in patients with SLE was found to depend on two parameters - the intensity of the disease and the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome; acute cerebral circulatory disorder and thrombocytopenia were observed to have a significant unidirectional impact on the level of Ab to CL. Immobilized CL-based ANSs were effective in eliminating Ab to CL from the whole blood of patients with SLE, without resulting in a significant hemolysis of blood corpuscles and in a reduction of total protein concentrations. The development and introduction of preventive methods for the early diagnosis of SLE may be extended, by using ANS based on Cat, XO, and CL antigen. The designing and putting into practice novel ANS-based hemosorbents may allow immunosorption to occupy a prominent place in the pathogenetic therapy of inflammatory autoimmune diseases.

25458025	Journal Article	This study aims to investigate the relationship of hemoglobin level with disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The hemoglobin level, the 66/68 joint count, the Disease Activity Score 28 joints (DAS28), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), the Visual Analog Scales (VAS), the Modified Sharp Score (MSS), and the disease duration in 89 patients with RA were used to analyze the possible relationship. The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for anemia uses a hemoglobin threshold of&lt;120g/L for women and&lt;130g/L for men. Pregnant or breastfeeding patients, patients with a history of other inflammatory or no inflammatory arthritis, malignancies, chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases and other diseases in the stage of decompensation were excluded from the study. Anemia was observed in 64% of the patients (1(st) group); the other group (2(nd) group) had normal levels of hemoglobin. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between hemoglobin level and swollen and tender joints\&#39; count, DAS28, HAQ score, VAS, MSS, and disease duration (p&lt;0.001). DAS28, HAQ score, VAS, MSS, swollen and tender joints\&#39; count and disease duration were significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher in 1(st) versus 2(nd) group. In conclusion, we determined that low hemoglobin level was significantly related to disability and impairment, disease activity, articular damage, pain and disease duration in RA patients in our study. We believe that by keeping disease activity under control, therefore preventing articular damage, the disability in RA patients can be lessened or possibly even eliminated.

16467036	Comparative Study	CD14, the monocyte receptor for lipopolysaccharides (LPS), is an important mediator of inflammatory processes. As the T-159C exchange in the promotor of the CD14 gene was reported to lead to enhanced CD14 expression, this could be a new susceptibility gene for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We investigated whether this single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) serves as a risk factor for disease development or has any influence on serological activity parameters of RA or soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels. A total of 130 patients with RA, diagnosed according to the revised American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, and 130 healthy subjects, all Caucasians, were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotype frequencies were compared by chi2 analysis. Forty (31%) patients vs. 39 (30%) controls were genotyped CC; 71 (55%) vs. 67 (52%) were heterozygous, and 19 (15%) vs. 24 (19%) showed the TT genotype (p = 0.7). Accordingly, the allele frequency was equally distributed (p = 0.8). There was also no significant difference in genotype distribution between subgroups of patients categorized according to serological activity parameters and sCD14 levels. We found no association between the CD14/C-159T polymorphism and increased risk for the development of RA or serological disease activity parameters or sCD14 levels.

27475801	Clinical Trial	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disease in which the predominant symptom is polyarthritis that follows a chronic and progressive clinical course characterized by destructive synovitis and various immune disorders. Striking progress in RA treatment was achieved with the emergence of monoclonal antibodies to target cytokines. However, drug choices are limited for many patients due to resistance to multidrug antirheumatic therapy, concomitant disease, and infection. We evaluated the efficacy of treatment in 85 patients with RA for whom leukocytapheresis (LCAP) was initiated at our hospital between 2006 and 2015. All patients continued drug therapy and were treated with LCAP once a week for up to 5 weeks. The clinical response was evaluated at the completion of LCAP series and 4 weeks later using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and the 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) of European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). The tender joint counts, swollen joint counts, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased remarkably. DAS28-CRP was significantly improved by LCAP. And furthermore, the efficacy lasted at least 4 weeks after the completion of LCAP. These results suggest that LCAP is a beneficial and are consistent with several trials\&#39; reported effect of LCAP. This treatment can contribute to improvements in activities of daily living (ADLs) and long-term outcome by improving swollen and tender joint counts and CRP levels even in refractory patients for whom the use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biopharmaceuticals is problematic. LCAP might be a promise therapy to refractory RA.

9972990	Journal Article	A proposed 4 page, 30-45 minute standard protocol to assess rheumatoid arthritis (SPERA) is described that includes all relevant measures of inflammatory activity such as joint swelling, measures of joint damage such as joint deformity, and outcomes such as joint replacement surgery, to monitor patients in longterm observational studies. Forms are included: (1) a patient self-report modified health assessment questionnaire (MHAQ) to assess function, pain, fatigue, psychological distress, symptoms, and drugs used; (2) assessor-completed forms: \&quot;RA clinical features\&quot; --criteria for RA, functional class, family history, extraarticular disease, comorbidities, joint surgery, radiographic score, and laboratory findings. (3) A 32 joint count with 5 variables: (a) a \&quot;shorthand\&quot; normal/abnormal so that normal joints require no further detailed assessment; (b) tenderness or pain on motion; (c) swelling; (d) limited motion or deformity; (e) previous surgeries; physical measures of function, i.e., grip strength, walk time, and button test. (4) Medication review of previous disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD), work history, and years of education. The forms allow cost effective acquisition of all relevant measures of activity, damage, and outcomes in routine clinical care, and allow recognition that measures of activity may show similar or improved values over 5-10 years, while measures of damage and outcomes indicate severe progression in the same patients. The SPERA is feasible to acquire most known relevant measures of activity, damage, and outcomes in RA in 30-45 min in usual clinical settings, to provide a complete database for analyses of longterm outcomes.

23320137	Journal Article	To evaluate the role of fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG PET) in various rheumatic diseases and its potential in the early assessment of treatment response in a limited number of patients. This study involved 28 newly diagnosed patients, of these 17 had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 11 had seronegative spondyloarthropathy (SSA). In the SSA group, 7 patients had ankylosing spondylitis, 3 had psoriatic arthritis, and one had non-specific SSA. Patients with RA were selected as per the American College of Rheumatology criteria. One hour after FDG injection, a whole body PET scan was performed from the skull vertex to below the knee joints using a GE Advance dedicated PET scanner. Separate scans were acquired for both upper and lower limbs. Post-treatment scans were performed in 9 patients in the RA group (at 6-9 wk from baseline) and in 1 patient with psoriatic arthropathy. The pattern of FDG uptake was analysed visually and quantified as maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in a standard region of interest. Metabolic response on the scan was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively and was correlated with clinical assessment. The qualitative FDG uptake was in agreement with the clinically involved joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein values and the clinical assessment by the rheumatologist. All 17 patients in the RA group showed the highest FDG avidity in painful/swollen/tender joints. The uptake pattern was homogeneous, intense and poly-articular in distribution. Hypermetabolism in the regional nodes (axillary nodes in the case of upper limb joint involvement and inguinal nodes in lower limb joints) was a constant feature in patients with RA. Multiple other extra-articular lesions were also observed including thyroid glands (in associated thyroiditis) and in the subcutaneous nodules. Treatment response was better appreciated using SUVmax values than visual interpretation, when compared with clinical evaluation. Four patients showed a favourable response, while 3 had stable disease and 2 showed disease progression. The resolution of regional nodal uptake (axillary or inguinal nodes based on site of joint involvement) in RA following disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs was noteworthy, which could be regarded as an additional parameter for identifying responding patients. In the SSA group, uptake in the affected joint was heterogeneous, low grade and non-symmetrical. In particular, there was intense tendon and muscular uptake corresponding to symptomatic joints. The patients with psoriatic arthritis showed intense FDG uptake in the joints and soft tissue. (18)F-FDG PET accurately delineates the ongoing inflammatory activity in various rheumatic diseases (both at articular and extra-articular sites) and relates well to clinical symptoms. Different metabolic patterns on FDG-PET scanning in RA and SSA can have important implications for their diagnosis and management in the future with the support of larger studies. FDG-PET molecular imaging is also a sensitive tool in the early assessment of treatment response, especially when using quantitative information. With these benefits, FDG-PET could play a pivotal clinical role in the management of inflammatory joint disorders in the future.

23124693	Journal Article	The levels of several inflammatory cytokines are abnormal in many patients with the fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and may play a role in its pathogenesis. The inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with the disease activity in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, but its role in FMS is unknown. We undertook this study to determine whether high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) is elevated in FMS and whether its levels relate to key biologic or clinical measures. One hundred and five patients with FMS (1990 ACR criteria) and 61 healthy normal controls (HNC) at a ratio of 2:1 were recruited. The serum concentrations of hsCRP, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The hsCRP levels were marginally higher in FMS than in HNC (p = 0.06) and its abnormality rate (&gt;1.5 SD above the HNC mean) was significantly higher in FMS (25 %) compared with HNC (6.8 %) (p = 0.03). Serum IL-8 levels, IL-6 levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in FMS did not differ from those in HNC. Body mass index (BMI), ESR, IL-8, and IL-6 levels correlated with hsCRP levels in FMS. No associations were found between hsCRP and age, gender, ethnicity, or other clinical measures. Serum CRP levels were higher in FMS and significantly correlated with BMI, ESR, IL-8, and IL-6 levels, suggesting that inflammation may contribute to the symptoms in some FMS patients, particularly those who are obese. Weight loss and therapies directed against inflammation may be useful in the management of FMS patients with elevated hsCRP.

2672925	Clinical Trial	To assess the safety and efficacy of amiprilose hydrochloride (HCl), a novel synthetic carbohydrate with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel group, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week trial. Two hundred and one functional class I and II patients with definite or classic rheumatoid arthritis, previously untreated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. Patients were withdrawn from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Those who flared were randomly assigned to amiprilose HCl, 6 g/d, or placebo for 12 weeks. No concomitant anti-inflammatory or antirheumatic drug therapy was permitted during the study. Combination acetaminophen and propoxyphene napsylate was the only supplemental analgesic medication allowed. The number of painful joints and swollen joints, joint pain and joint swelling indices, left and right grip strength, investigator global assessment, and patient global assessment returned to baseline for the amiprilose group and showed statistically significant (P less than 0.05) differences from the placebo group within 4 to 6 weeks. The protocol criteria for overall therapeutic response were satisfied by 41% of the amiprilose patients, compared with 21% of the placebo group (P = 0.003). Approximately 0.5 tablet per day less analgesic medication was taken by the amiprilose group (P less than 0.05 at weeks 6 and 12). There were no statistically significant differences in morning stiffness, walking time, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or rheumatoid factor between the groups. A similar number of adverse experiences were reported by the patients on amiprilose (67%) and on placebo (63%). One patient on amiprilose developed thrombocytopenia of unknown cause; no other reported adverse effects were serious. Amiprilose HCl has significant anti-inflammatory activity and a favorable safety profile when used as the sole antirheumatic therapy in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. Synthetic carbohydrates may represent an important new class of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune diseases.

17874627	Clinical Trial	Leflunomide is a relatively new disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and a number of studies evaluating its effectiveness and safety in daily medical practice is limited. Evaluation of effectiveness and safety of leflunomide treatment in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate was ineffective or contraindicated. Eighty one patients (66 women and 15 men) with RA diagnosed according to ARA (The American Rheumatism Association) criteria were included in the study. The mean age was 57.6+/-11.7 years and the mean disease duration was 7.7+/-7.1 years. The inclusion criteria were: disease activity according to DAS28 (Disease Activity Score)&gt;3.2 and contraindications to methotrexate or ineffective methotrexate treatment for at least 3 months. At the beginning of the study 49 of patients were treated with methotrexate in weekly dose of 17+4.2mg and 32 were not treated with DMARDs. Oral glicocorticosteroids in stable doses of 5-15mg of prednisone were given to 66 (77.7%) of them. There was no statistically significant difference in radiological progression of the disease according to Steinbrocker\&#39;s scale between groups (treated and not treated with methotrexate). Monotherapy with leflunomide was started with loading dose of 100mg for 3 days, and then 20mg daily. Combination therapy was introduced without loading dose. Evaluation was performed monthly and included: duration of morning stiffness, pain and disease activity according to VAS (visual-analogue) scale, the number of tender and swollen joints, blood count, ESR, CRP, aminotransferases activity, and the presence and intensity of adverse reactions. The results of treatment were evaluated after 5 months in 37 of patients and adverse reactions which happened until the end of 5th month were evaluated in all included patients. The mean DAS28 values improved exponentially during consecutive months and the difference between them was statistically significant. Adverse reactions during 5 months of treatment were observed in 36(44,4%) of patients and in 6(7,4%) of cases the treatment had to be stopped because of side effects. The frequency of adverse reactions was similar in monotherapy and combination therapy group. Leflunomide therapy can be effective in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in whom methotrexate is contraindicated or insufficient. Combination of leflunomide with methotrexate is safe and does not increase the frequency of adverse reactions.

11669155	Clinical Trial	To study magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features in the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in 4 patient groups: early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (&lt; 3 yrs); established RA (&gt; 3 yrs); other arthritis; arthralgia. MRI was obtained before and after contrast (gadodiamide) injection of the wrist and finger joints in 103 patients and 7 controls. The study included: (1) 28 patients with disease duration &lt; 3 yrs who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA; (2) 25 patients with RA disease duration &gt; 3 yrs who fulfilled the ACR criteria. (3) 25 patients with reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or mixed connective tissue disease; and (4) 25 patients with arthralgia. The following MRI variables were assessed: number of joints with enhancement after contrast injection, number of joints with joint fluid, and number of bones with edema in the wrist and fingers. The volume of the enhancing synovial membrane after contrast injection in the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints was manually outlined. MR images were scored independently under blinded conditions. Bone marrow edema was found in 68% of the patients with established RA, and the number of bones with edema was significantly higher in patients with established RA compared to patients with early RA, other arthritis, and arthralgia (Mann-Whitney p &lt; 0.04). Bone edema was not found in patients with arthralgia. There was marked overlap within and between the patient groups. No differences in MRI features were found between patients with early RA and patients with other arthritis. The volumes of the synovial membrane in the MCP, PIP, and DIP joints were significantly higher in patients with arthritis compared to patients with arthralgia. Although there was marked overlap between the arthritis patient groups, MRI determined bone marrow edema and synovial membrane volumes provided additional information about disease activity and may be used as a marker of it. Bone marrow edema appeared with the highest percentage in patients with long duration of RA (&gt; 3 yrs) and is probably secondary to changes in inflammatory activity.

21666989	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common form of autoimmune arthritis. Increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in RA may occur secondary to specific drug treatment and reduced physical activity associated with this condition. However, some recent studies suggest contradictory theories about the association of RA with MetS. This study was designed to evaluate the frequency of MetS in RA patients and the relationship between MetS with RA disease activity and body mass index (BMI). The study was conducted on 120 RA patients and 431 age- and sex-matched apparently healthy controls. A considerable proportion of patients were being treated with prednisolone and/or methotrexate and/or hydroxychloroquine. Disease activity was measured by the 28 joint count of disease activity score-Cerythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28ESR). MetS was evaluated according to International Diabetic Federation (IDF) and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) criteria. The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in the control group (p = 0.005). We did not find any difference in the prevalence of MetS between the patients with DAS &lt; 3.2 and DAS ≥ 3.2. There was no association between the DAS28 score and the presence of MetS components by either definition. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of a DAS &gt; 3.2 in patients with BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2 (OR = 0.1, p = 0.01) and BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 (OR = 0.3, p = 0.1), in comparison to BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2, was 1/5 and 1/3, respectively. RA was not found to increase the risk of MetS. In addition, disease activity in RA patients was not influenced by the presence of MetS.

131876	Comparative Study	The Freund\&#39;s adjuvant technic, using killed Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in mineral oil, is a refined tool for anti-inflammatory drug evaluation. Its use has long been reserved for testing and not for screening due to technical problems in the preparation of valid animal models. After reviewing the methodology, the authors demonstrated that the availability of arthritic rats from a modern breeding center (Charles River France, SA, Elbeuf, France) make the procedure applicable to drug screening. This has both practical and economic advantages. The animals can be used as test organisms for drug evaluation 14 da after treatment. Three criteria for measuring the effectiveness of anti-arthritic drugs have been established: an arithritic index determined by examination of the 4 paws; changes in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and changes in levels of plasma fibrinogen. The curative activity of test substances can be evaluated by a single series of measurements of these 3 criteria after 14 da of treatment. This test was compared with 2 others; edema of the paw induced by the subcutaneous injection of kaolin or carrageenan, and was found to be superior.

29148413	Journal Article	Targeting remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improves health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability. However, the impacts of different remission criteria and durations and their frequencies are uncertain. Our observational study assessed these factors. We recruited RA patients with disease durations &lt;10 years, stable suppressive therapies and stable disease activity scores for 28 joints using ESR (DAS28-ESR) ≤3.2. Intermittent and sustained remisisons were classified using DAS28ESR, simple disease activity index (SDAI) and ACR/EULAR Boolean criteria. HRQoL, measured using SF-36, fatigue, EuroQol and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) was compared using time-integrated areas under the curve (AUC). 104 patients were enrolled and followed for 12 months. DAS28-ESR remissions were intermittent in 42%, sustained in 47% and absent in 11%. Boolean remissions were intermittent in 38%, sustained in 10% and absent in 52%. Baseline remissions by all criteria significantly improved HAQ, Euroqol, SF36 and fatigue scores compared with low disease activity (LDAS); AUCs showed significant benefits for all HRQoLs persisted over 12-months. Boolean remissions achieved most benefits. Over time all remission states gave significantly better HRQoL scores than LDAS. Sustained DAS28ESR and SDAI remissions improved HRQoL more than intermittent remissions. Sustained and intermittent Boolean remissions gave similar improvements. Analysis of SF-36 domains showed even sustained Boolean remissions failed to optimise pain and fatigue. All remissions improve HRQoL but different criteria have variable impacts. Boolean remission had most impact but occurred least. There are trade-off between optimising individual impacts (Boolean remissions) and achieving maximal overall impacts (DAS28-ESR remissions).

14644857	Clinical Trial	To develop response criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) for monitoring treatment and comparing alternative treatments regimens. 76 patients, mean (SD) age 68.7 (7.7) years, were enrolled. Corticosteroids, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the only drugs allowed during the observation period. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), alpha(2) globulin, serum iron, pain, physician\&#39;s global assessment (PGA), morning stiffness (MST), muscle tenderness (MT), myalgia, and the elevation of upper limbs (EUL) were determined regularly. The daily corticosteroid and NSAID doses as the corticosteroid response time were recorded. To ensure evaluation of an adequate number of patients (n = 57) week 24 was chosen for final analysis. ESR, CRP, alpha(2) globulin, pain, PGA, MST, myalgia, MT, and EUL showed significant improvement (p&lt;0.0001) at week 24 compared with week 0. Multiple regression analysis showed that changes of ESR (p = 0.08), CRP (p = 0.41), alpha(2) globulin (p = 0.13), MST (p = 0.1), and MT (p = 0.07) were independent of pain, but myalgia (p&lt;0.001) and EUL (p = 0.003) were pain dependent. Consequently, a core set of PMR response criteria, comprising ESR or CRP, pain, PGA, MST, and EUL was established. Assessment of treatment responses with this core set resulted in 90%, 70%, 50%, and 20% improvement in 31/57 (54%), 46/57 (81%), 51/57 (89%), and 54/57 (95%) of the patients, respectively.

15345504	Journal Article	To analyse the association of interleukin 10 (IL10) promoter polymorphisms, which have been shown to be related to IL10 secretion capacity, with the response to long term treatment with etanercept in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Fifty patients with active RA were treated for up to 4 years (median 39 months, range 3-52) with stable doses of etanercept as monotherapy. Treatment response was assessed as defined by the EULAR criteria in an intention to treat analysis, with the last observation carried forward. IL10 promoter microsatellite polymorphisms IL10.R and IL10.G were genotyped by fragment length analysis in patients and 189 healthy controls matched for ethnicity, age, and sex. Haplotypes were reconstructed using a method based on bayesian, coalescent theory with the PHASE software. IL10 microsatellite polymorphisms were not associated with susceptibility to RA. When patients with good treatment response (n = 25) were compared with patients with moderate (n = 17) or no response (n = 8), a significantly different distribution of the prevailing alleles R2, R3 and G9, G13, respectively, became evident. Good treatment response was associated with carriage of the R3 allele or R3-G9 haplotype, whereas the allele G13 and the haplotype R2-G13 predominated in patients with moderate or no response. Genotyping of the IL10 promoter microsatellites may be useful in predicting the clinical response to etanercept in patients with RA. The high prevalence of the presumptive IL10 low producer allele R3 in patients with a favourable response suggests that IL10 promotes disease activity in RA under the specific condition of tumour necrosis factor antagonism.

10371665	Journal Article	An experimental paradigm, based on the microcrystalline sodium urate-induced arthritis pain model, was used to investigate the potential peripheral analgesic properties of a variety of opioid agonists. The response criteria were changes in behavioral profiles and pain-related behaviors over 60 min commencing 1 h after intraarticular injection. The testing system was used to determine the potential optimum dose of intraarticular application of morphine sulphate (1-3 mg), fentanyl citrate (0.5-3 mg), and buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.05-1 mg). None of the opioid analgesics used had any effect on pain behavior, and it was concluded that opioids with a high affinity for the mu receptor when injected intraarticularly were unlikely to be of use in the treatment or diagnosis of inflammatory arthritic pain in the strain of domestic fowl chosen.

29392761	Journal Article	Evidence-based clinical diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthritis are not available. To establish (i) criteria for clinical diagnosis of TMJ arthritis and (ii) clinical variables useful to determine inflammatory activity in TMJ arthritis using synovial fluid levels of inflammatory mediators as the reference standard. A calibrated examiner assessed TMJ pain, function, noise and occlusal changes in 219 TMJs (141 patients, 15 healthy individuals). TMJ synovial fluid samples were obtained with a push-pull technique using the hydroxycobalamin method and analysed for TNF, TNFsRII, IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-1sRII, IL-6 and serotonin. If any inflammatory mediator concentration exceeded normal, the TMJ was considered as arthritic. In the patient group, 71% of the joints were arthritic. Of those, 93% were painful. About 66% of the non-arthritic TMJs were painful to some degree. Intensity of TMJ resting pain and TMJ maximum opening pain, number of jaw movements causing TMJ pain and laterotrusive movement to the contralateral side significantly explained presence of arthritis (AUC 0.72, P &lt; .001). Based on these findings, criteria for possible, probable and definite TMJ arthritis were determined. Arthritic TMJs with high inflammatory activity showed higher pain intensity on maximum mouth opening (P &lt; .001) and higher number of painful mandibular movements (P = .004) than TMJs with low inflammatory activity. The combination TMJ pain on maximum mouth opening and Contralateral laterotrusion &lt;8 mm appears to have diagnostic value for TMJ arthritis. Among arthritic TMJs, higher TMJ pain intensity on maximum mouth opening and number of mandibular movements causing TMJ pain indicates higher inflammatory activity.

14969053	Comparative Study	A substudy within a larger study of patients with inflammatory arthritis of less than one year, to analyze baseline measures or joint counts, laboratory values, patient questionnaires and ARA diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis, as predictors of one year performance and functional status. 229 patients with synovitis of less than one year were enrolled and evaluated at baseline and one year. Measures included the number of swollen or tender joints [active joint counts]; biological indices of inflammation [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)]; and patient questionnaire measures of pain [Wisconsin Brief Pain Inventory], fatigue [multi-dimensional assessment of fatigue], depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale], sleep [Sleep Quality Index], performance [Human Activity Profile], and function [Sickness Impact Profile ambulation subscale and Health Assessment Questionnaire]. Correlations between these measures were evaluated using the Spearman rank order correlation. Patients were classified according to whether they met ARA criteria for RA, had high (&gt; 7) or low (&lt; or = 7) numbers of affected joints; and high, intermediate, or low levels of performance; and were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. At baseline, an active joint count of &gt; 7 versus &lt; or = 7 was associated significantly with higher age, rheumatoid factor positivity, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis versus spondyloarthropathy or undifferentiated arthritis, and receiving a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), but not with sex, race, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), or receiving prednisone. Furthermore, high baseline active joint counts were associated significantly with patient questionnaire scores for maximum activity, fatigue and depression, but differences were not significant for sleep, ambulation and pain scores. A comparison of patients who met or did not meet criteria for RA indicated significant differences only according to the fatigue scores, but none of the other questionnaire measures. Correlations of baseline measures with one-year performance were highest for the baseline active joint count compared to laboratory and questionnaire variables. The maximum activity score at one year was predicted significantly by the baseline maximum activity score, active joint count, and age, but not by laboratory tests or whether the patient met criteria for RA. The active joint count predicts subsequent performance and function for patients with recent onset, inflammatory synovitis more effectively than whether patients met ARA criteria for RA.

15338490	Journal Article	To compare the level of morning stiffness in a cohort of patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), assessed on a self-report questionnaire, to levels of patient self-report scores and clinical and laboratory variables. A total of 337 patients with recent onset RA since 1998 were assessed for tender and swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), physician global assessment, and radiographs of the hands and feet, as well as Multidimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) scores for functional disability, pain, fatigue, global status, morning stiffness, and number of symptoms. Regression models were used to estimate possible associations between these variables and morning stiffness. At study entry, 70 patients (21%) reported no morning stiffness, 52 (15%) reported morning stiffness &lt; 15 minutes, 52 (15%) for 16-59 minutes, and 163 (49%) for &gt;/= 1 one hour. At baseline and in longitudinal analyses, morning stiffness was significantly associated with functional disability scores on the MDHAQ and with other patient self-report data, and was associated at lower levels with swollen and tender joint counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The degree of morning stiffness appears to reflect functional disability and pain more than traditional markers of inflammation such as joint counts and ESR in patients with early RA. Inclusion of morning stiffness as a marker of inflammatory activity in classification criteria for RA, inclusion criteria for most clinical trials in RA, and RA remission criteria, may be open to reassessment.

8694574	Journal Article	To determine a cut off value for changes in radiological joint space width that allowed definition of radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis not related to measurement method errors and, thereafter, to determine factors predictive of radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis and to evaluate the correlations between clinical and radiological parameters. A prospective, longitudinal (one year duration), multicentre study was made of patients with osteoarthritis of the hip (American College of Rheumatology criteria). Data on clinical activity (pain, functional impairment), demographic data (age, gender, body mass index), and femoral head migration (superolateral, superomedial, concentric) were collected when the patient entered the study; radiological grade (joint space width in millimetres at the narrowest point using a 0.1 mm graduated magnifying glass, evaluated by a single observer unaware of the chronology of the films) was recorded at the patient\&#39;s entry to the study and after one year. Analysis of the means of the differences between two analyses performed by a single observer of 30 pairs of radiographs (one performed after an interval of one year) (0.06 (SD 0.23)) suggested that a change of more than 0.56 mm (2 SD) after a one year follow up could define progression of osteoarthritis of the hip. Of the 508 patients recruited, 461 (91%) completed the one year follow up and radiological progression was observed in 102 (22%). The factors predictive of radiological progression that were identified in the multivariate analysis were: radiological joint space width at entry &lt; or = 2 mm, superolateral migration of the femoral head, female gender, Lequesne\&#39;s functional index &gt; 10, age at entry &gt; 65 years (odds ratios 2.11, 4.25, 2.51, 2.66, 1.90, respectively). The level of clinical parameters (pain, functional impairment) and the amount of symptomatic treatment required (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesic intake) accounted for 20% (p &lt; 0.0001) of the variability of the changes in radiological joint space width over the one year study period. These data suggest that radiological progression of hip osteoarthritis could be defined by a change in joint space width of at least 0.6 mm after a one year follow up period, is correlated with the changes in clinical status of the patients, and is related not only to demographic data (age, gender), but also to some specific characteristics of osteoarthritis (localisation, radiological severity, clinical activity).

27147781	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by symmetrical polyarthritis and multisystemic involvement. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of low dose of methotrexate on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This paper follows a retrospective study, which involves 60 female patients with early onset RA diagnosed according to the American Rheumatism Association Criteria (ACR/EULAR 2010). The patients were divided into two groups group I was composed of thirty patients treated with dose of 7.5 mg/weekly methotrexate (MTX), while group II included thirty patients treated with dose of 2 g/daily sulfasalazine (SSZ). The Disease Activity was measured by a combination of Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and Disease Activity Score (DAS-28). Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine (L2-4), and femoral neck, was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) (Stratos 800). Laboratory findings included: In this study, we found no negative effect on BMD in RA patients treated with low dose MTX in comparison to patients treated with SSZ. There was not observed significant difference in BMD of the lumbar spine, femur neck or trochanter, of MTX and SSZ patients in the pretreatment phase, nor after 12 months of treatment. No significant change in the biochemical parameters of the both groups. Based on the results of our study, low dose of methotrexate has no negative effect on BMD in premenopausal RA patients. We believe that these results might provide new insights and that further longitudinal studies with larger groups of premenopausal RA patients are required.

21243305	Journal Article	Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the axial skeletal system, causing pain and functional incapacity. To measure the impact of AS on patient\&#39;s life, questionnaires are used to assess disease activity (BASDAI); functional incapacity (BASFI); and quality of life (ASQoL). Fibromyalgia (FM) is one of the most common causes of generalized pain and can coexist with other diseases; it can be assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Few studies have demonstrated correlations between FM and AS. The present study obtained data regarding the epidemiologic profile of patients with AS and FM and evaluated the prevalence of FM in patients with AS. The FM influence on BASDAI, BASFI and ASQoL test scores was assessed. A total of 71 patients with AS, diagnosed according to the modified New York criteria, were studied. Clinical and functional assessment was performed and BASDAI, BASFI and ASQoL tests were applied. Patients with a diagnosis of FM were evaluated through the FIQ. Eleven patients met the criteria for FM; thus a FM prevalence of 15% was observed among the patients with AS. FM was more prevalent among women (3.8:1). Age at disease onset (AS) was 27.5 years. The HLA-B27 antigen was positive in most of them (80.4%). When comparing BASDAI, BASFI and ASQoL test means, it was observed that values are significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) among patients with FM. We concluded that the coexistence of FM can worsen AS activity aspects, as well as functional incapacity and quality of life.

22229862	Journal Article	To investigate indirectly the prevalence of intestinal inflammation in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients by assessing the levels of fecal calprotectin, to study levels of serum calprotectin in AS, and to correlate the concentrations of calprotectin in feces and serum with reported gastrointestinal symptoms, medication, and measures of disease activity. All patients fulfilling the Modified New York criteria of AS at the study centers were invited to participate. The patients answered questionnaires concerning medication, symptoms, and disease activity. Physical examination was performed, including back mobility tests. Samples of stools and blood were collected and analyzed for fecal and serum calprotectin. Elevated levels of fecal calprotectin (&gt;50 mg/kg) was found in 140 of 205 AS patients (68%). Levels of fecal calprotectin were associated with increasing age, disease duration, ESR, CRP, and serum calprotectin, but not with gastrointestinal symptoms. Fecal calprotectin was higher in patients using NSAIDs, salicylates, and proton pump inhibitors, but lower in patients using methotrexate and infliximab. Serum calprotectin levels were normal or low in 98% of AS patients and not different from the levels in healthy blood donors. Serum calprotectin levels were positively associated with ESR, CRP, WBC, and PLT. Two-thirds of AS patients had elevated levels of fecal calprotectin, without associated gastrointestinal symptoms. Serum calprotectin was mostly normal in AS, in contrast to various other inflammatory rheumatic diseases. We suggest that fecal calprotectin may be a marker for subclinical intestinal inflammation in AS and should be measured after stopping NSAIDs, but further endoscopic studies are needed.

16784252	Journal Article	Nitronaproxen [AZD 3582, HCT 3012, naproxen nitroxybutylester, NO-naproxen] is a naproxen derivative with similar anti-inflammatory activity to the parent compound, but with less gastrointestinal toxicity. It is the first of a new class of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs known as cyclo-oxygenase-inhibiting nitric oxide donators (CINODs), which are under development by NicOx. The better gastrointestinal tolerability of nitronaproxen appears to be due to its release of nitric oxide (NO) and the consequent maintenance of tissue perfusion and integrity. Nitronaproxen is in phase III clinical development for the treatment of osteoarthritis and is available for licensing. AstraZeneca had been a worldwide licensee for nitronaproxen and other CINODs. However, the results of phase II clinical trials of nitronaproxen did not fulfill AstraZeneca\&#39;s strategic commercial criteria for further investment and NicOx reacquired rights following AstraZeneca\&#39;s decision to discontinue its involvement in 2003. NicOx was surprised by AstraZeneca\&#39;s decision, and remained fully convinced of the potential of nitronaproxen. NicOx is seeking new partners for development of compounds of the CINOD class. Nitronaproxen is in a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The 13-week trial completed enrolment of 820 patients from 120 clinical sites in the US in May 2006. The study is designed to confirm that nitronaproxen is superior to placebo and is as effective as naproxen in relieving signs and symptoms of OA. The study will also seek to show that nitronaproxen has no adverse effect on blood pressure. An additional trial has begun that is employing ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to provide a description of the blood pressure effect of nitronaproxen over a 24-hour period in hypertensive subjects. This US trial will enrol approximately 120 volunteers with stable essential hypertension. The volunteers will not have osteoarthritis but will be between the ages of 50 and 75 years (representative of the osteoarthritis population). Results from both trials are expected in the fourth quarter of 2006. The phase II clinical programme for nitronaproxen, which included 2709 patients in five separate clinical studies, showed that the drug is a potent, safe anti-inflammatory agent, with potential for improved cardiovascular safety over NSAIDs and COX-2 selective NSAIDs. An independent advisory board recommended further development of nitronaproxen in the treatment of osteoarthritis in 2004 based on an evaluation of the full results of the phase II clinical programme.A clinical study had begun in September 2004 at the University of Pennsylvania in patients with mild essential hypertension, in which the effects of nitronaproxen and rofecoxib on arterial blood pressure would be compared. However, rofecoxib was withdrawn worldwide on 1 October 2004. It is unclear if the trial was completed. The STAR Multinational Study Group has conducted a phase II gastrointestinal safety and efficacy study of nitronaproxen versus naproxen in 970 patients with osteoarthritis at 80 sites in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Hungary, Mexico, Norway, Poland, South Africa and the UK. The study was completed in November 2002. AstraZeneca conducted a randomised, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of nitronaproxen among 672 subjects with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Results have been presented. Certain phase II trial data from 2003 had been somewhat disappointing. However, an underpowered trial and failures and deficiencies in a trial meant that it was not possible to draw conclusions from this data.

28569163	Journal Article	Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) demonstrate reduced aerobic capacity, excess cardiovascular risk, mobility limitations and are less physically active than their healthy peers. Physical activity may decrease RA disease activity through its anti-inflammatory effects and psychological and health benefits. To successfully manage RA symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risks associated with RA through increased physical activity (PA), accurate physical activity assessments are critical. Accelerometry is an objective physical activity measure, but not widely used. Validity of the Nurses\&#39; Health Study physical activity questionnaire II (NHSPAQ) has not been determined for estimation of physical activity in RA. This study examined NHSPAQ validity in adults with RA compared to accelerometry-based metabolic equivalents determined (METs) and results of performance tests. We hypothesized NHSPAQ scores would correlate moderately (0.4-0.5) with accelerometer physical activity estimates. Thirty-five adults with RA (mean age [SD] 62 (Williams et. al, Health Qual Life Outcomes 10:28, 2012) years, 28 females (80%) recruited from a hospital-based clinic registry participated in a one-week accelerometry trial. Medical data was compiled. Participants completed the NHSPAQ, a self-paced 20-m walk test, and modified timed step test. Participants wore an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days, then completed a physical activity log and another NHSPAQ. Metabolic equivalents (METs) were derived from NHSPAQ and accelerometers using standardized formulas. NHSPAQ METs were correlated with accelerometer METs and data from performance measures. Average disease duration was 21 years (SD = 11), 63% patients took biologics. The average weekly METs reported were 29 (SD = 33) and accelerometer METs were 33 (SD = 22). NHSPAQ METs correlated moderately with accelerometer-derived METs (r = 0.48 95% CI (0.15-0.70). Self-reported PA correlated moderately with Step Test performance (r = 0.50 95% CI (0.18-0.72). Patients with RA exhibit low physical activity levels. General fitness measures were moderately correlated with physical activity levels. A moderate significant correlation existed between NHSPAQ and accelerometry METs. These preliminary data suggest the NHSPAQ may be useful to describe physical activity levels in this population.

12733982	Journal Article	Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are still the most commonly used remedies for rheumatic diseases. But NSAIDs produce serious adverse effects, the most important being gastric injury up to gastric ulceration and renal damage. Several strategies have been adopted in order to avoid these shortcomings, especially gastrointestinal toxicity. So, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been associated with gastroprotective agents that counteract the damaging effects of prostaglandin synthesis suppression: however, a combination therapy introduces problems of pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and patient s compliance. Also incorporation of a nitric oxide (NO)-generating moiety into the molecule of several NSAIDs was shown to greatly attenuate their ulcerogenic activity: however, several findings suggest a possible involvement of NO in the pathogenesis of arthritis and subsequent tissue destruction. A most promising approach seemed to be the preparation of novel NSAIDs, specific for the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX-2): they appear to be devoid of gastrointestinal toxicity, in that they spare mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. However, a number of recent studies raised serious questions about the two central tenets that support this approach, namely that the prostaglandins that mediate inflammation and pain are produced solely via COX-2 and that the prostaglandins that are important in gastrointestinal and renal function are produced solely via COX-1. So, increasing evidence shows that COX-2 (not only COX-1) also plays a physiological role in several body functions and that, conversely, COX-1 (not only COX-2) may also be induced at sites of inflammation. Moreover, COX-2 selective NSAIDs have lost the cardiovascular protective effects of non-selective NSAIDs, effects which are mediated through COX-1 inhibition (in addition, COX-2 has a role in sustaining vascular prostacyclin production). The products generated by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (leukotrienes) are particularly important in inflammation: indeed, leukotrienes increase microvascular permeability and are potent chemotactic agents; moreover, inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase indirectly reduces the expression of TNF-alpha (a cytokine that plays a key role in inflammation). This explains the efforts to obtain drugs able to inhibit both 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenases: the so-called dual acting anti-inflammatory drugs. Such compounds retain the activity of classical NSAIDs, while avoiding their main drawbacks, in that curtailed production of gastroprotective prostaglandins is associated with a concurrent curtailed production of the gastro-damaging and bronchoconstrictive leukotrienes. Moreover, thanks to their mechanism of action, dual acting anti-inflammatory drugs could not merely alleviate symptoms of rheumatic diseases, but might also satisfy, at least in part, the criteria of curative drugs. Indeed, leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory, increase microvascular permeability, are potent chemotactic agents and attract eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes into the synovium. Finally, recent data strongly suggest that dual inhibitors may have specific protective activity also in neurodegeneration.

16376805	Journal Article	To investigate the clinical response and to evaluate by magnetic resonance imaging the inflammatory tissue changes in refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with infliximab. Sixteen refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients who were treated with intravenous infliximab (3 mg/kg) at weeks 0, 2, 6 and every 8 weeks thereafter were examined with magnetic resonance imaging of the dominant affected wrist and hand before treatment and 1 year after therapy. The volume of the enhancing inflammatory tissue was evaluated in fat suppressed contrast enhanced T1-weighted images by using the Analyse 4.0 software. Disease activity was evaluated by assessing the disease activity score for 28 joint indices. The clinical improvement was evaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria. There were 13 females and 3 males with mean age 49.5 (17.0) years and mean disease duration 10.5 (8.0) years. Ten patients had positive IgM rheumatoid factor. One year after treatment, a significant reduction of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, the C-reactive protein, the disease activity score for 28 joint indices and the volume of the enhancing inflammatory tissue was observed. All but two of the rheumatoid arthritis patients achieved the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria, while 9 (56.25%) and 5 (31.25%) patients achieved the 50% and 70% American College of Rheumatology response criteria, respectively. A positive correlation among the volume of the enhancing inflammatory tissue, swollen joint count, tender joint count, as well as disease activity score for 28 joint indices (r=0.66, r=0.79, r=0.57 respectively) was found before treatment. In refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients, the addition of infliximab therapy may result in clinical, laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging assessment of the volume of the enhancing inflammatory tissue may represent an additional tool for the investigation of joint disease activity and responsiveness to treatment.

DAS28ESR, DAS28CRP, SDAI, CDAI, and ACR/EULAR remission criteria were applied and reduced 12-joint US examination was performed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. At baseline and month 12, radiographs of hands and feet were obtained in a subset of patients. A blind independent reader scored radiographs. X-ray progression was defined as Sharp van der Heijde change score &gt;1 and no progression was defined as ≤0. 319 of 357 patients completed the study; patients had a mean (SD) age of 53.5 (13.1) years, with a disease duration of 7.5 (7.1) years. Laboratory, clinical, and US values significantly improved at month 6, except CRP, with additional improvement at month 12. Remission and low disease activity rates increased at follow-up. In the subset of 115 patients with radiological studies, clinical remission by any definition was not significantly associated with X-ray progression. Patients without PD signal at baseline and month 6 were a lower risk of X-ray progression than patients with PD signal, OR 0.197 (95% CI 0.046-0.861) and 0.134 (95% CI 0.047-0.378), respectively. Absence of PD signal, but not clinical remission predicts lack of X-ray progression. A feasible 12-joint US examination may add relevant information to RA remission criteria.

26903390	Journal Article	Two recent double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showed that oral steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have similar analgesic effectiveness for management of gout, but the trials had small sample sizes and other methodological limitations. To compare the effectiveness and safety of oral prednisolone versus oral indomethacin in patients presenting to emergency departments (EDs) with acute gout. Multicenter, double-blind, randomized equivalence trial. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to receive either indomethacin or prednisolone. (ISRCTN registry number: ISRCTN45724113). Four EDs in Hong Kong. 416 patients aged 18 years or older. Analgesic effectiveness was defined as changes in pain (at rest or with activity) greater than 13 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale. Outcomes were measured during the first 2 hours in the ED and from days 1 to 14. 376 patients completed the study. Equivalent and clinically significant within-group reductions in mean pain score were observed with indomethacin and prednisolone in the ED (approximately 10 mm [rest] and 20 mm [activity]) and from days 1 to 14 (approximately 25 mm [rest] and 45 mm [activity]). No major adverse events occurred during the study. During the ED phase, patients in the indomethacin group had more minor adverse events than those in the prednisolone group (19% vs. 6%; P &lt; 0.001). During days 1 to 14, 37% of patients in each group had minor adverse events. Diagnosis of gout was usually based on clinical criteria rather than examination of joint fluid. Oral prednisolone and indomethacin had similar analgesic effectiveness among patients with acute gout. Prednisolone is a safe, effective first-line option for treatment of acute gout.

15868611	Journal Article	To study the frequency of remission using 3 sets of criteria in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at 5 years after the diagnosis. All adult patients with recent onset inflammatory arthritis who did not meet criteria or show clinical signs of other specific arthritides were included in the RA1997 inception cohort at Jyväskylä Central Hospital, Finland, and were assessed for remission at 5-year control examination. Remission was defined as (1) American College of Rheumatology (ACR) remission (fatigue excluded), (2) clinical remission with no tender and no swollen joints and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and (3) radiographic remission with no worsening of erosions and no new erosions from baseline to 5 years. The study included 127 patients with early RA (mean age 56 yrs, 61% female, 54% with positive rheumatoid factor, and 25% with erosions). At 5 years, 111 patients were examined, 17% (95% CI 11%-25%) of whom met ACR remission criteria, 37% (95% CI 28%-47%) met clinical remission criteria, and 55% (95% CI 49%-68%) met radiographic remission criteria. Only 13 (12%) patients met all 3 sets of remission criteria. The rate of remission was statistically significantly different (p &lt; 0.001) using the 3 sets. The rate of remission in RA depends on the criteria used. No gold standard exists for defining remission in RA. A set of criteria including no sign of inflammatory activity and no radiographic progression might be a basis for development of clinically relevant remission criteria for RA.

28814431	Journal Article	Calprotectin is an inflammatory marker of interest in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We evaluated whether the level of calprotectin was associated with disease activity, and if it was predictive of treatment response and radiographic progression in patients with early RA. Plasma from disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve patients with RA fulfilling 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism classification criteria with symptom duration &lt;2 years was analysed for calprotectin at baseline, and after 1, 3 and 12 months. All patients received treat-to-target therapy, as part of a randomised controlled strategy trial (ARCTIC). The association between calprotectin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) and measures of disease activity were assessed by correlations. We used likelihood ratios and logistic regression models to assess the predictive value of the baseline inflammatory markers for treatment response and radiographic damage. 215 patients were included: 61% female, 82% anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive, mean (SD) age 50.9 (13.7) years and median (25, 75 percentile) symptom duration 5.8 (2.8, 10.5) months. Calprotectin was significantly correlated with Clinical Disease Activity Index (r=0.32), ESR (r=0.50) and ultrasonography power Doppler (r=0.42) before treatment onset. After 12 months of treatment, calprotectin, but not ESR and CRP, was significantly correlated with power Doppler (r=0.27). Baseline levels of calprotectin, ESR and CRP were not predictive of treatment response, but high levels of calprotectin were associated with radiographic progression in multivariate models. Calprotectin was correlated with inflammation assessed by ultrasound before and during DMARD treatment, and was also associated with radiographic progression. The data support that calprotectin may be of interest as an inflammatory marker when assessing disease activity in different stages of RA. NCT01205854; Post-results.

20158894	Journal Article	Angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are critical in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as they could be a key issue for chronic synovitis. Contradictory results have been published regarding circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in RA. We herein investigated late outgrowth EPC sub-population using recent recommendations in patients with RA and healthy controls. EPCs, defined as Lin-/7AAD-/CD34+/CD133+/VEGFR-2+ cells, were quantified by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 59 RA patients (mean age: 54 +/- 15 years, disease duration: 16 +/- 11 years) and 36 controls (mean age: 53 +/- 19 years) free of cardiovascular events and of cardiovascular risk factors. Concomitantly, late outgrowth endothelial cell colonies derived from culture of PBMCs were analyzed by colony-forming units (CFUs). RA patients displayed higher circulating EPC counts than controls (median 112 [27 to 588] vs. 60 [5 to 275]) per million Lin- mononuclear cells; P = 0.0007). The number of circulating EPCs positively correlated with disease activity reflected by DAS-28 score (r = 0.43; P = 0.0028) and lower counts were found in RA patients fulfilling remission criteria (P = 0.0069). Furthermore, late outgrowth CFU number was increased in RA patients compared to controls. In RA, there was no association between the number of EPCs and serum markers of inflammation or endothelial injury or synovitis. Our data, based on a well characterized definition of late outgrowth EPCs, demonstrate enhanced levels in RA and relationship with disease activity. This supports the contribution of vasculogenesis in the inflammatory articular process that occurs in RA by mobilization of EPCs.

7934491	Clinical Trial	Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a critical inflammatory mediator in rheumatoid arthritis, and may therefore be a useful target for specific immunotherapy. In support of this hypothesis, we previously observed beneficial responses in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis after open-label administration of a chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF alpha (cA2). We now report the results of a four-centre, randomised double-blind trial of a single infusion of 1 or 10 mg/kg cA2 compared with placebo in 73 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The primary endpoint of the study was the achievement at week 4 of a Paulus 20% response, an amalgam of six clinical, observational, and laboratory variables. Intention-to-treat analysis of data from individual patients showed only 2 of 24 placebo recipients responding at this time, compared with 11 of 25 patients treated with low-dose cA2 (p = 0.0083) and 19 of 24 patients treated with high-dose cA2 (p &lt; 0.0001). Over half of the high-dose cA2 patients responded by the more stringent 50% Paulus criteria at this time (p = 0.0005). The magnitude of these responses was impressive, with maximum mean improvements in individual disease-activity assessments, such as tender or swollen-joint counts and in serum C-reactive protein, exceeding 60% for patients on high-dose treatment. There were two severe adverse events. 1 patient on 1 mg/kg cA2 developed pneumonia (\&quot;possibly\&quot; treatment-related) and 1 on 10 mg/kg had a fracture (\&quot;probably not\&quot; treatment-related). The results provide the first good evidence that specific cytokine blockade can be effective in human inflammatory disease and define a new direction for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

14963203	Journal Article	To examine the frequency of gouty arthritis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and elucidate the clinical factors that predispose to this occurrence. A chart review of in-patients (1989-2001) and out-patients (1999-2001) with ICD9 billing codes for gouty arthritis/tophaceous gout and SLE was performed. Twenty-six patients were identified. Patients meeting American College of Rheumatism criteria for SLE and crystal-proven gout or a self-limited inflammatory arthritis felt to be crystal-induced (i.e. definite gout) were included. Ten patients were identified. Their mean age was 46.5 yr; 80% were African-American and 70% were women. Nine of the ten had lupus nephritis and four had undergone renal transplantation. An acute worsening of renal function unrelated to lupus activity preceded almost all gout flares. Lupus activity at the time of the first gout attack as measured by the Systemic Lupus Activity Measure (SLAM) was low. Eight patients were on prednisone (mean dose 8 mg/day) for their SLE at the time the attack of gout occurred. Gouty arthritis is uncommon in SLE; it occurs primarily in patients with long-standing SLE and nephritis. Worsening renal function usually preceded gout attacks, but SLE disease activity was minimal. Crystal-induced arthritis should be included in the differential diagnosis of a lupus patient presenting with acute inflammatory arthritis because the long-term treatment of the two conditions differs substantially.

6350377	Clinical Trial	In order to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tolmetin sodium in the treatment of both rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis in geriatric patients, a retrospective study was made of patients 65 years and older who participated in long-term, controlled, double-blind and open trials during both the investigational period and since marketing of the drug. Standard entrance criteria, methods of evaluating disease activity, and statistical methods were used in the study of both arthritic diseases. A total of 847 geriatric patients were studied for periods of up to one year; 171 had RA, while 676 had osteoarthritis of large or small joints. Average daily dose of tolmetin sodium was 1141 mg for patients with RA and 953 mg for patients with osteoarthritis. The results of this retrospective study of both RA and osteoarthritis patients show that tolmetin was as effective in geriatric patients as in nongeriatric patients. Symptoms responded rapidly to treatment with tolmetin, and both the inflammatory symptoms of RA and the joint pain and functional parameters of osteoarthritis showed improvement that was both statistically and clinically significant throughout the major course of therapy. Tolmetin was also found to be safe and well tolerated by the elderly patient population. The major complaints were gastrointestinal, but serious or limiting side effects occurred in few patients. The dropout rates due to adverse effects during the entire year of therapy were 15.8 per cent in the RA population and 15.4 per cent in osteoarthritis patients. This retrospective evaluation of tolmetin therapy shows significant relief of the symptoms of both RA and osteoarthritis in a geriatric population and fails to reveal any unusual or serious conditions which would contraindicate its use in the elderly patient. Tolmetin, which is an antiinflammatory agent with a short half-life, can provide adequate, safe therapy in the geriatric population.

29748857	Journal Article	The coronary artery calcification (CAC) progression may be useful noninvasive predictor of future cardiovascular events (CVE). The progression rate of CAC in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is poorly understood. To assess the dynamic of CAC scores in early RA patients for 18 months, 74 RA adult patients (ACR/EULAR criteria, 2010, duration ≤ 12 months, with moderate/high RA activity, without prior administration of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs or glucocorticoids) were enrolled within the framework of the observational study: women 73%, median age 56 years, median RA duration 6 months, median DAS28[ESR] 5.4. Most of the patients had multiple Traditional Risk Factors (TRFs) of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). All patients at baseline and after 18 months underwent 32-row scanning for CAC scoring. In patients younger than 45 years (n = 16) any CAC was not detected during 18 months. Among patients older than 45 years four new events of CAC were detected. Among patients older than 45 years with baseline CAC (n = 34) increase in CAC scores was detected in 82% cases. Among them, Δ Agatston Score exceeded the median annual Agatston Score progression predicted for the general population according to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) data in 57% of early RA patients. The significant increase of Agatston Score in accordance with Sevrukov\&#39;s method was met in one patient with newly diagnosed CAC and among patients with baseline CAC-in 29%. The presence of CAC progression was associated with lower baseline total cholesterol (TC) level (p &lt; 0.05). The extent of CAC progression associated with male gender and arterial hypertension (AH) (p &lt; 0.05). Association between CAC dynamic and statin therapy, RA activity and cumulative inflammatory burden, response to anti-rheumatic therapy and the type of this therapy were not detected. Early RA patients older than 45 years have high incidence of CAC progression during 18 months. More than half of the early RA patients had the increase in AS which exceeded the median annual progression of Agatston Score in the MESA. The CAC progression was associated with male gender, AH and lower baseline TC level. We did not detect any association between CAC progression and statin therapy, RA activity and type of anti-rheumatic therapy.

28532452	Journal Article	Pain is inherent in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and spondyloarthritis (SpA) and traditionally considered to be of nociceptive origin. Emerging data suggest a potential role of augmented central pain mechanisms in subsets of patients, thus, valid instruments that can identify underlying pain mechanisms are needed. The painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ) was originally designed to differentiate between pain phenotypes. The objectives were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PDQ in patients with inflammatory arthritis by applying Rasch analysis and to explore the reliability of pain classification by test-retest. For the Rasch analysis 900 questionnaires from patients with RA, PsA and SpA (300 per diagnosis) were extracted from \&#39;the DANBIO painDETECT study\&#39;. The analysis was directed at the seven items assessing somatosensory symptoms and included: 1) the performance of the six-category Likert scale; 2) whether a unidimensional construct was defined; 3) the reliability and precision of estimates. Another group of 30 patients diagnosed with RA, PsA or SpA participated in a test-retest study. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and classification consistency were calculated. The Rasch analysis revealed: (1) Acceptable psychometric rating scale properties; the frequency distribution peaked in category 0 except for item 5, threshold calibration &gt;10 observations per category, no disorder in the category measures for all items, scale category outfit Mnsq &lt;2.0, small distances (&lt;1.4 logits) between thresholds for category 1, 2 and 3 for all items. (2) The principal component analysis supported unidimensionality; the standardized residuals showed that 53.7% of total variance was explained by the measure and the magnitude of first contrast had an eigenvalue of 1.5, no misfitting items, clinical insignificant different item hierarchies across diagnoses (DIF &lt; 0.5 logits). (3) A targeted item-person map, person and item separation indices of 1.88(reliability = 0.78), and 13.04 (reliability = 0.99). The test-retest revealed: ICC: RA 0.86(0.56-0.96), PsA 0.96(0.74-0.99), SpA 0.93(0.76-98), overall 0.94(0.84-0.98). Classification consistency was: RA 70%, PsA 80%, SpA 90%, overall 80%. The results support that the PDQ can be used as a classification instrument and assist identification of underlying pain-mechanisms in patients suffering from inflammatory arthritis.

29123576	Journal Article	The biosimilar product Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; has been approved by the European Medicine Agency (EMA) for the same indications as its reference drug, infliximab, based on studies in patients with rheumatic diseases. Thus far, there have not been enough data regarding its efficacy and safety in ulcerative colitis (UC). To assess the efficacy and safety of the biosimilar product Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; in comparison with its reference biological agent (Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) in rescue therapy in adult patients presenting with severe exacerbation of UC, as well as to evaluate recurrence rate during a 6-month observation after finish of treatment. In a single-centre retrospective study, a cohort of 83 adult patients with severe UC treated at the Department of Gastroenterology with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Subdivision of the Central Clinical Hospital of MSWiA, Warsaw was investigated. All patients received three induction doses of Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (28 individuals) or Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (55 individuals) based on the same criteria of the National Health Fund (NFZ) Therapeutic Program (total Mayo score &gt; 6). Activity of the disease was evaluated on the Mayo scale at qualification, after finishing the rescue treatment (after 14 weeks), and after a 6-month observation period. In all patients, sigmoidoscopy was performed at qualification and after induction (after three doses). The studied groups were similar with respect to age and sex distribution, duration of the disease, extent of the disease (left-sided type, pancolitis), additional pharmacotherapy, and smoking. Clinical response following three induction doses was noted in 81% of patients receiving Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 77% receiving the biosimilar product, Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (NS); while clinical remission was observed in 42% receiving Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and 32% receiving Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (NS), respectively. Endoscopic remission assessed as 0 on the Mayo scale was achieved in 4 (15%) patients on Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and in 7 (13%) patients on Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.45). Relapse occurred in 68% of all patients, while 51% presented with exacerbation of the disease 3 months after finishing biological treatment. In 93%, exacerbation occurred within 12 months. The recurrence rate was similar in both groups (75% with Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, 64% with Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively). Side effects occurred with similar frequency in both groups. In the study, it was established that the biosimilar drug (Inflectra&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) has a similar efficacy and safety as the reference biological agent (Remicade&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;), not only in rescue therapy, but also during a 6-month observation period in adult patients with severe UC. Low mucosal healing rate in both groups and high recurrence rate of the disease soon after finishing induction treatment indicate the need for prolonged therapy with infliximab in patients with severe UC.

24680620	Journal Article	The seeds of Vitex negundo L. (Verbenaceae) have been commonly used as a folk remedy for the treatment of rheumatism and joint inflammation in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the anti-arthritic activity of the extract of V. negundo seeds (EVNS) using Freund\&#39;s complete adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis (AA) in rat model. As a result, EVNS, with abundant phenylnaphthalene-type lignans, significantly inhibited the paw edema, decreased the arthritis score and spleen index, and reversed the weight loss of CFA-injected rats. Histopathological studies showed a marked decrease of synovial inflammatory infiltration and synovial lining hyperplasia in the joints of EVNS-treated animals. The remarkable decrement of serum inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6) were observed in EVNS-treated rats, whereas, IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was found to be significantly increased by EVNS. The expressions of COX-2 and 5-LOX in PBMC were also inhibited by administration of EVNS. Our results demonstrated that V. negundo seeds possessed potential therapeutic effect on adjuvant induced arthritis in rats by decreasing the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and increasing that of IL-10 in serum as well as down-regulating the levels of COX-2 and 5-LOX, and therefore may be an effective cure for the treatment of human rheumatoid arthritis.

23877410	Journal Article	This systematic review aimed at investigating the role of therapeutic exercise and/or manual therapy in the treatment of hip osteoarthritis (OA). Two independent reviewers (AR, CV) searched PubMed, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, PEDro and Scopus databases and a third one (SP) was consulted in case of disagreement. The research criteria were publication period (from May 2007 to April 2012) and publication language (English or Italian). Ten randomized controlled trials matched inclusion criteria, eight of which concerning therapeutic exercise and two manual therapy. Few good quality studies were found. At mid- and long-term follow-up land-based exercises showed insufficient evidence of effectiveness with respect to pain and quality of life, but positive results were found for physical function. Water exercises significantly reduced fall risk when combined with functional exercises. Programs containing progressive and gradual exposure of difficult activities, education and exercises promoted better outcomes, higher adherence to home program and increased amount of physical activity, especially walking. Manual therapy seemed to reduce pain and decrease disability at short-term. Less use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was statistically significant at long-term follow-up in patients treated with manual therapy. The relationship between clinical results and radiological grade of OA was not investigated. Encouraging results were found in recent literature for manual therapy and functional training. Further research is needed to elucidate this issue through high-quality trials, especially addressing the aspects that have not been thoroughly explored yet, for instance type, amount and scheduling of conservative treatment.

21619619	Clinical Trial	The primary objectives were to explore the associations between a comprehensive ultrasonographic (US) assessment of joints, tendons and bursae and previously described reduced joint counts (7-, 12-, 28- and 44-joint score) as well as to assess the sensitivity to change of these different US joint combinations during biological treatment. Twenty patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were examined by US (B-mode (BM) and power Doppler (PD)) with use of a semi-quantitative (0 to 3) score of 78 joints, 36 tendons/tendon groups and two bursae (hereafter described as the 78-joint score) at baseline and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after initiating treatment with adalimumab. BM and PD scores for the different joint combinations were generated. The reduced joint scores had high correlation coefficients with the 78-joint score at all examinations (range 0.79 to 0.99 for BM and 0.77 to 0.99 for PD, each P &lt; 0.001) and sum BM and PD scores of all the different joint combinations improved significantly during follow-up (P ≤ 0.05 to 0.001). The reduced joint combinations were highly associated to the 78-joint score. Furthermore, all the joint combinations presently explored responded well to biological treatment. This indicates that an approach focusing on few joints and tendons gives equivalent information about the inflammatory activity in RA patients as a comprehensive US examination. The optimal combination of joints and tendons for a valid, reliable and feasible US measurement should be further explored to define a US score for follow-up of RA patients on biological treatment.

21921094	Journal Article	We aimed to systematically review rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease severity indices for use in administrative healthcare databases. We also provide an overview of alternative methods to control for RA disease severity in administrative database research. We conducted a systematic review of studies that developed/validated an index for RA disease severity using variables in administrative databases, and compared the convergent validity/reliability of the index with a standard measure of RA severity. After reviewing 539 articles, 2 studies were included. The claims-based index for RA severity (CIRAS) was developed in one study. Components of the CIRAS included tests for inflammatory markers, number of chemistry panels/platelet counts ordered, rheumatoid factor test, number of rehabilitation and rheumatology visits, and Felty\&#39;s syndrome. The CIRAS correlated moderately well with a previously validated RA medical records-based index of severity. The second study assessed whether current and lifetime treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and/or biologics accurately predicted RA severity, as measured by the patient-reported Patient Activity Scale (PAS). Treatment variables did not fully distinguish patients in the highest and lowest quartiles of PAS scores (67.2% correctly classified). Two claims-based indices of RA severity were identified but have some limitations for routine use. A concerted effort from experts in the field is needed to define, develop, and validate a widely applicable measure of RA disease severity for administrative database research.

23257762	English Abstract	Data on the prevalence and features of cognitive impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are presented. Cognitive impairment was noted in 66% of patients, it did not reach the threshold of dementia and met the diagnostic criteria for moderate cognitive impairment. Anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders were found in 94% patients. Cognitive impairment was associated with apathic affect and anxiety-depressive spectrum disorders (depressive episodes, dysthymia, and elevated anxiety). The impairment of thinking was correlated with the high to moderate inflammatory activity including non-joint RA symptoms, higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and low doses of glucocorticoids. Cognitive impairment was not associated with the duration and character of standard treatment of RA and concomitant cardiovascular diseases.	NA	Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

27749227	Journal Article	To analyse clinical, serological and sonographic differences between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and polyarticular psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients on anti-TNF therapy in clinical remission. Angiogenic and proinflammatory cytokine serum levels were determined by multiplex ELISA in patients with RA and PsA in clinical remission (DAS28-ESR&lt;2.6), clinically-active RA patients (DAS28&gt;3.2) and healthy controls. Ultrasound (US) scans were made of both wrists and hands. 30 RA and 47 PsA patients in remission, 22 active RA patients and 20 healthy controls were included. PsA patients had significantly lower disease activity according to DAS28-ESR (p=0.006) but not according to DAS28-CRP (p=0.319), and lower serum levels of proinflammatory and angiogenic cytokines than RA patients in remission. PsA patients had cytokine levels similar to healthy controls, while RA patients in remission had similar levels to those of active RA patients. Globally, 31 (40.25%) patients in remission had a PD signal and 12 had SH&gt;2 plus PD [1 PsA vs. 11 RA (p=0.0001)], meeting the criteria for ultrasound-defined active synovitis (UdAS). Patients with UdAS had significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-20, PIGF and SDF1. More PsA patients were on tapered doses of anti-TNF (63.8%), and more frequently as monotherapy (72.3%), compared with RA patients (26.6% and 20%, respectively). Polyarticular PsA patients in remission had lower levels of local (US synovitis) and systemic inflammation than RA patients in remission, even though a significantly higher percentage of PsA patients were on tapered doses of anti-TNF, mainly in monotherapy.

6543671	English Abstract	This paper describes a morphologic, quantitative, cytochemical study of mononuclear non lymphoid cells in knee synovial fluid in osteoarthritis and various arthritides. Morphologic criteria allow to identify among these cells various synoviocytic and monocytic subtypes with in both types, phagocytic subtypes. Quantitative study shows in arthritides an important afflux of monocytes and a hyperexfoliation of synoviocytes. In fluids with intermediate cellularity, Monocytes/Synoviocytes ratio allows the differential cytodiagnosis between osteoarthrosis and arthritis. All monocytic subtypes and especially the phagocytic one are highly significantly increased in arthritides. Synoviocytic subtypes show a lower increase, except the phagocytic one, which is not changed. Giant multinuclear synoviocytes are found in every type of disease and cannot constitute a cytodiagnosis marker. Alcian Blue and hyaluronidase treatment show hyaluronate in a few percentage of Synoviocytes. Cytoenzymologic study shows that synoviocytes and monocytes are positive in all tested hydrolases: beta Glucuronidase, Acid Phosphatase, alpha Naphthyl Acetate Esterase, these activities being always higher in synoviocytes. With peroxidase, synoviocytes are always negative, so this reaction although it marks only a minority of monocytic population can be used as an extra cytologic criterion for discrimination of mononuclear cells in synovial fluid. In these four enzymes there is no significant quantitative difference at cellular level between osteoarthrosis and arthritides. Lysosomal enzymatic activity in both monocytic and synoviocytic cells confirms their heterophagic properties. However synoviocytic heterophagy seems to be a physiological process not or few affected by inflammatory events. On the opposite, monocytic heterophagy and then macrophagic transformation of monocytes appears as a major aspect of intrasynovial inflammatory reaction. If a large majority of exfoliated synoviocytes comes from A type synovial lining cells and if they belong to Mononuclear Phagocyte System, why do they so weakly, or not, participate as phagocytes to inflammatory reaction.

14977577	Clinical Trial	Basal serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and somatostatin concentration were measured by standard radioimmunoassay in patients with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology as well as in a group of age-matched normal subjects. RA patients exhibited significantly elevated (age, 45-55 yrs, p less than 0.05; 55 yrs and older, p less than 0.01) serum growth hormone levels compared to age-matched individuals from the control group. IGF-1 was unchanged. Serum somatostatin levels were reduced in RA patients between 45 and 55 yrs but reached a significant reduction (p less than 0.0001) in RA patients, 55 years and older compared to age-matched individuals from the control group. RA patients treated with prednisone did not exhibit changes in either growth hormone or IGF-1 levels compared to RA patients treated principally with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and methotrexate. These results indicated that symptomatic RA is associated with elevated serum growth hormone without concomitant changes in IGF-1 compared to individuals from the control group. Reduced somatostatin levels in older RA patients resulted in a skewed upward growth hormone to somatostatin ratio. We conclude that the serum growth hormone to somatostatin ratio may be a useful surrogate marker of disease activity in symptomatic RA.

27453744	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease with autoimmune pathogenesis. It affects mainly small joints (of the hands and feet) and has many systemic manifestations. Studying biomarkers in rheumatology intensely appeared from the need to understand the mechanisms underlying some rheumatic diseases. Discovering new biomarkers with key roles in various stages of evolution, remains a subject of interest for RA. Currently, according to the EULAR 2010 criteria, the rheumatoid factor (RF) and the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) are used for RA diagnosis. Since 2010, new biomarkers were discovered and proved useful in identifying RA in early stages. For a more rigorous management of these cases, one of the key steps in the evolution of patients with RA is to recognize and distinguish the more aggressive forms of the disease through prognostic biomarkers. \&quot;Treat to target\&quot; recommends the use of 3 composite scores to monitor the evolution of the disease: disease activity score (DAS 28), simple disease activity index (SDAI) and clinical disease activity index (CDAI), but, a new test was developed which better monitors the disease activity. The introduction of biological therapies has revolutionized the treatment of RA. Despite these advances, 20-40% of the patients are declared nonresponders to at least one of the therapies. The patient exposure to the potential side effects and high costs requires the discovery of a biomarker that could identify those who can benefit from the pretreatment of a certain therapy. RA = rheumatoid arthritis, RF = rheumatoid factor, DAS 28 = disease activity score, SDAI = simple disease activity index, CDAI = clinical disease activity index, ACR = American College of Rheumatology, EULAR = European League against Rheumatism, anti-CCP = antibodies against cyclic citrullinated proteins, anti-MCV = mutated citrullinated vimentin antibodies, anti-CarP = antibodies against carbamylated proteins, MBDA = multi biomarker disease activity test, COMP = cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, ADAs = antidrug antibodies, CDA = clinical disease activity index, SDAI = simplified disease activity index, ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP = C reactive protein, SAA = serum amyloid A, VCAM-1 = vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, IL-6 = interleukin-6, TNF-R1 = tumor necrosis factor receptor 1, EGF = epidermal growth factor, VEGF-A = vascular endothelial growth factor A.

11465711	Clinical Trial	Studies evaluating osteoarthritis treatment often use increased arthritis activity (\&quot;flare\&quot;) as a selection criterion, although no standardized assessments are available to quantify flare intensity and little is known about how this criterion affects treatment comparisons. This study evaluated the reliability of a flare assessment and how pretreatment flare intensity impacts conclusions on treatment efficacy. Using data from a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial (n = 182), we compared 3 osteoarthritis treatments with placebo in patients who met 3 of 4 flare criteria. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire was used to document levels of pain, stiffness, and physical functioning at baseline and at the final visit. Following factor analytic evaluation, the flare items were standardized and summed to create a flare intensity index, which was used to identify patient subgroups. Analysis of covariance was applied to compare change in WOMAC scale scores from baseline to final visit for assessment of treatment differences among the flare intensity subgroups. The flare indicators appeared unidimensional. Analyses were stratified by tertiles of flare intensity. Mean WOMAC scores improved in the patients receiving active treatment who were categorized into the 2 lowest flare intensity subgroups, but mean WOMAC scores improved in patients in all 4 treatment groups (active and placebo) in the most intense flare subgroup. Patients with higher intensity flares may be more likely to report substantial improvement in functional status regardless of treatment. Failure to account for flare intensity in analyses of data from pain trials with flare-based designs may inflate the risk of Type I and Type II errors in the interpretation of study results.

19237406	Comparative Study	To evaluate the impact of standardised consultations on patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. Open pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial. Primary care in France. 198 primary care rheumatologists, each of whom had to include two consecutive patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee. Standardised consultation was provided during three goal oriented visits (education on osteoarthritis and treatment management; information on physical exercises; information on weight loss) or usual care. Change in body weight and in time spent on physical exercises (Baecke index) at four months. 336 patients were included (154 allocated to standardised consultation and 182 to usual care). Nine patients were excluded because of lack of baseline data (standardised consultation, n=8; usual care, n=1). At four months, taking into account the clustering effect, the decrease in weight was greater in the standardised consultation group than in the usual care group (mean -1.11 (SD 2.49) kg v -0.37 (2.39) kg; P=0.007). The physical activity score was higher for the standardised consultation group than for the usual care group (mean 0.20 (0.65) v 0.04 (0.78); P=0.013). The standardised consultation and usual care groups did not differ in secondary outcomes, except for global assessment of disease activity (0-10 numeric scale: mean -1.66 (2.26) v -0.90 (2.48); P=0.003) and pain level (0-10 numeric scale: mean -1.65 (2.32) v -1.18 (2.58); P=0.04).

10503557	Clinical Trial	The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of a new formulation of cyclosporin-A (CyA) and sulfasalazine (SASP) combination treatment in preventing disability and reducing inflammatory disease activity in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, as well as to assess the tolerability, safety, and suitability for long-term treatment. Forty five patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis, (RA) were treated with CyA and SASP combination therapy for 12 months. The patients were evaluated by disease activity and radiologic measurements. The combined CyA and SASP therapy seems to be effective. Disease activity parameters improved within 3 months. The individual treatment response rate according to EULAR response criteria was 78% after a one year treatment period. Five patients were withdrawn due to gastrointestinal side effect and two patients because of lack of efficacy. CyA and SASP combination treatment seems to be effective in early severe RA, and with careful monitoring, side effects can be kept under control.

8070822	Journal Article	It is assumed that subcutaneous nodule (SCN), one of the major criteria in acute rheumatic fever (ARF), is rare and whenever these nodules appear, they are invariably associated with carditis. Further large number of nodules appear in crops and they are evanescent. This prospective study of 42 cases of ARF with SCN attempts to analyse the accuracy of such statements. The group comprised of 12.5% of 336 consecutive cases of ARF. Other major criteria associated with SCN were carditis in 38 (90.4%), arthritis in 33 (78.5%) and chorea in two (4.7%). No evidence of carditis could be found in 4 (9.5%). When a detailed study of SCN was done the average number of nodules found in the group was 18 (range 4-49). Thirteen (30.9%) had less than 10 nodules and 5 (11.9%) had only 4-5 nodules. With initiation of treatment SCN disappeared within 4 weeks in 29 (69%), within next 5-8 weeks in 8 (19%) and within 9-12 weeks in 3 (7.1%). In two cases (4.7%) multiple nodules were observed 12 weeks later when all other evidences of activity had disappeared. The study shows a comparative high incidence of SCN in ARF, not all being associated with carditis. Number of nodules appearing in ARF might be quite small and they could persist for long inspite treatment.

18785316	Journal Article	To investigate the effect of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment on rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and its association with treatment response and acute-phase reactants. In a cohort of 188 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with adalimumab, baseline IgM-RF and ACPA were determined by ELISA, and compared to levels after 28 weeks of treatment. ACPA were measured as antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP). The relative change of antibody levels was correlated to the European League Against Rheumatism response criteria and to the change in acute-phase reactants [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)]. The median decline in IgM-RF levels was greater than the decline in ACPA levels (31% vs 8%; p&lt;0.001). The decrease in antibody levels was greater in the group of good responders than in the group of nonresponders [43% vs 7% for IgM-RF (p&lt;0.0001) and 16 vs -4% for ACPA (p=0.03)]. Seventeen percent of IgM-RF-positive patients at baseline turned negative at 28 weeks; this qualitative effect was not observed for ACPA. Further, the decline in IgM-RF, but not ACPA, was associated with a decrease in CRP and ESR (p=0.004 and p=0.006, respectively). TNF treatment directly influences IgM-RF and ACPA levels, but in those responding to treatment only. The effect on IgM-RF levels and positivity status is greater than on ACPA levels and is associated with the decline in markers of inflammation. These results further emphasize the differential role these autoantibodies may play in RA; IgM-RF as marker of inflammatory activity, and ACPA as qualitatively stable hallmark of RA.

20647995	Journal Article	Both cachexia and cardiovascular disease are strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and linked to the chronic inflammatory process. Typically, rheumatoid cachexia occurs in individuals with normal or increased BMI (reduced muscle mass and increased fat mass). Classic cachexia (reduced muscle mass and reduced fat mass) is rare in RA but is associated with high inflammatory activity and aggressive joint destruction in patients with a poor cardiovascular prognosis. Conversely, obesity is linked to hypertension and dyslipidemia but, paradoxically, lower RA disease activity and less cardiovascular disease-related mortality. Rheumatoid cachexia might represent the \&#39;worst of both worlds\&#39; with respect to cardiovascular outcome, but until diagnostic criteria for this condition are agreed upon, its effect on cardiovascular disease risk remains controversial.

23099471	Journal Article	The inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) directly stimulates C-reactive protein (CRP) expression. The present study aimed to examine how clinical treatment outcomes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with tocilizumab (TCZ), a humanised monoclonal anti-IL-6 receptor antibody, are related to CRP levels monitored for 52 weeks. One hundred and twenty-two RA patients who underwent TCZ treatment between May 2008 and September 2009 were registered in the Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry. Data were collected at initiation of treatment (baseline) and over 52 weeks for Disease Activity Score 28-ESR (DAS28-ESR), Boolean core measurements, serum CRP levels and matrix metalloproteinase-3 levels. To compare clinical results, patients were divided into three groups based on treatment time required to achieve normal CRP levels. Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model found that higher CRP levels at baseline was a significant and independent factor in predicting normal CRP levels over 52 weeks (hazard ratio 0.86 per 1 mg/dL). In contrast, disease duration, concomitant methotrexate use and previous tumour necrosis factor inhibitor failure were not significant factors. Patients with normal CRP levels at 12 weeks of TCZ treatment achieved better clinical outcomes, including remission based on DAS28-ESR criteria, compared to patients with elevated CRP levels at 12 weeks. Adequate suppression of pathological IL-6 signalling during TCZ treatment improves clinical outcomes and can be monitored with serum CRP levels, a readily available biomarker in clinical practice.

10529140	Journal Article	To determine the relationship of biochemical markers of bone metabolism in patients with mild ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with disease activity, bone mineral density (BMD), and vertebral fractures. A total of 56 male patients with mild AS were studied. All patients had BMD measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and hip and radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spines. Radiographs of patients with AS were evaluated morphometrically and vertebral fractures were defined using established criteria. Serum osteocalcin, total and bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP, BALP, respectively), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), parathyroid hormone (PTH), urinary deoxypyridinoline (Dpyr), and pyridinoline (Pyr) were measured in the patients with AS and compared with 52 age and sex matched controls. Thirty-nine healthy male subjects aged 50-60 years, recruited from primary care registers, had spinal radiographs and served as controls for vertebral fractures. Patients with AS had reduced BMD of the lumbar spine, 0.98 (0.1) g/cm2 [T score = -1.14 (1.2) and Z score = -1.01 (1.2)], and femoral neck, 0.83 (0.1) g/cm2 [T score = -1.44 (1.2) and Z score = -0.73 (1.1)]. Of the 56 patients with AS, 11 (19.6%) had a vertebral fracture, whereas only one of 39 control subjects did (2.6%). Patients with AS had significantly lower mean serum osteocalcin compared with controls [9.03 (2.7) microg/l vs 11.05 (2.33) microg/l; p &lt; 0.001], and significantly higher mean serum ALP [73.09 (19.5) U/l vs 53.02 (16.7) U/l; p &lt; 0.001] and BALP [38.54 (9.9) U/l vs 30.35 (8.28) U/l; p &lt; 0.001]. There was no significant difference in the excretion of Dpyr and Pyr between patients with AS and controls [4.90 (3.9) nmol/mmol vs 4.00 (3.6) nmol/mmol, and 15.66 (10.8) nmol/mmol vs 12.24 (10.3) nmol/mmol, respectively]. There were no significant differences in the mean 25-OHD and PTH levels in patients with AS compared to controls [20.03 (1.6) micromol/l vs 18.9 (2.9) micromol/l and 3.31 (1.5) pmol/l vs 2.63 (0.4) pmol/l, respectively]. The biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption correlated well with inflammatory indices of disease activity (acute phase reactants), but not with BMD of the lumbar spine or femoral neck. No significant difference was seen in any marker of bone turnover when AS patients with vertebral fractures were compared with those without. Bone turnover in patients with mild AS is characterized by low serum osteocalcin and ALP in the presence of normal calciotropic hormones. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism do not correlate with BMD or vertebral fractures. The disparity between osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase in patients with AS needs further evaluation.

10556262	Comparative Study	To determine, for the first time, plasma levels of general fibronectin (Fn) and two spliced isoforms, Ed-A and Ed-B, in patients with spondyloarthropathy (SpA) in comparison with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy volunteers (HV). Plasmas (EDTA) as well as clinical data, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were collected in two groups of 10 patients fulfilling the European Spondylarthropathy Study Group criteria for SpA or the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA. Plasmas of 21 blood donors served as controls. Plasma levels of Fns were determined by using an in-house immunocapture ELISA, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against general Fn and its isoforms. Total Fn plasma levels were significantly higher in the SpA group (mean+/-S.D.=1387+/-569 mg/l) than in the RA group (684+/-196 mg/l; P=0.02) and in HV (303+/-211 mg/l; P&lt;0.0001). Ed-A Fn levels appeared higher in SpA (23+/-10.4 mg/l) and RA (32.5+/-16.5 mg/l) groups than in the HV group (2.8+/-0.9 mg/l; P=0.0003 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively), without a significant difference between SpA and RA groups. Ed-B Fn levels were higher in SpA (6.9+/-2.1 mg/l) than in RA (3.2+/-1.9 mg/l; P=0. 02) and HV (1.1+/-0.8 mg/l; P=0.0003) groups. No significant correlation was observed in SpA patients between each Fn level and clinical activity, ESR or CRP levels. This study showed an increase in plasma levels of Fn and Ed-B Fn in SpA patients compared with RA patients and HV, which could not be attributed solely to systemic inflammation. It may be hypothesized that Ed-A and Ed-B Fn might reflect local turnover in inflamed tissues, and that Ed-B Fn might be particularly involved in the musculoskeletal inflammatory process of SpA.

25711875	Journal Article	(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)F-FDG PET/CT) has become useful for the detection and diagnosis of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatic diseases, immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related disease and giant cell arteritis. However, few articles based on small sample sizes (n = 7) diagnosed as adult-onset Still\&#39;s disease (AOSD) have been published. The study aim was to observe the reliable characteristics and usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of consecutive patients with AOSD. Eligible patients were selected from among those who had undergone (18)F-FDG PET/CT between May 2007 and June 2014. Twenty-six consecutive AOSD patients were recruited retrospectively according to criteria set by Yamaguchi et al. All patients underwent evaluation by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. The characteristics and usefulness of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for evaluation of consecutive patients with AOSD were evaluated. All 26 patients had (18)F-FDG-avid lesion(s) related to their particular disease. Diffuse and homogeneous accumulation of (18)F-FDG was seen in the bone marrow (26/26; 100 %; maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax), 2.10-6.73) and spleen (25/26; 96.15 %). The SUVmax of affected lymph nodes was 1.3-9.53 (mean ± SD, 4.12 ± 2.24). The SUVmax and size factors (maximum diameter and areas) of affected lymph nodes were significantly different (P = 0.033 and P = 0.012, respectively). (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed the general distribution of (18)F-FDG accumulation. This factor helped to exclude malignant disease and aided the diagnosis of AOSD (42.3 %) in 11 cases when combined with clinical features and aided decisions regarding appropriate biopsy sites, such as the lymph nodes (n = 9) and bone marrow (n = 13). (18)F-FDG PET/CT is a unique imaging method for the assessment of metabolic activity throughout the body in subjects with AOSD. Characteristics or patterns of AOSD observed on (18)F-FDG PET/CT can be used for the indication and diagnosis or to guide the clinical management of ASOD.

16793841	Journal Article	Patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS)-a major contributor to CVD-in a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and its relationship with rheumatoid arthritis related factors is investigated here. 200 outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis (147 women and 53 men), with a mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of 63 (11) years, and 400 age and sex-matched controls were studied. MetS was assessed according to the adult treatment panel III criteria and rheumatoid arthritis disease activity by the disease activity score of 28 joints (DAS28). A standard clinical evaluation was carried out, and a health and lifestyle questionnaire was completed. The overall prevalence of MetS was 44% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 41% in controls (p = 0.5). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were more likely to have low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with controls (p = 0.02), whereas controls were more likely to have increased waist circumference or raised blood pressure (p = 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for demographics and rheumatoid arthritis treatment modalities, the risk of having moderate-to-high disease activity (DAS28&gt;3.2) was significantly higher in patients with MetS compared with those with no MetS components (OR 9.24, 95% CI 1.49 to 57.2, p = 0.016). A high, albeit comparable to the control population, prevalence of MetS was found in middle-to-older aged patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The correlation of rheumatoid arthritis disease activity with MetS suggests that the increased prevalence of coronary heart disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis may, at least in part, be attributed to the inflammatory burden of the disease.

24528339	English Abstract	Clinical characteristics of rheumatoid arthritis (AR) justify its multidisciplinary approach, within which nutritional intervention is included. Certain nutritional components influence the cellular metabolism and interfere in the pathological inflammatory process, so that they may act as coadjutant in the treatment of many inflammatory diseases, among which AR is in - cluded. To analyze the evidence related to the therapeutical effects of the polyunsaturated fatty acids, mediterranean diet, olive oil and certain antioxidant nutrients, on chronic inflammation and AR symptomatology. Non-Systematic revision in Cochrane, Pubmed, Scopus, Sportdiscus and Amed, from 2003 to March 2013, and subsequent applications of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Evidence on polyunsaturated fatty acids suggests that they produce clinical improvement and inhibitory effects over the AR inflammatory response. As regards the mediterranean diet, evidence points out that it decreases both pain and disease activity. In the case of the olive oil, although there are not enough studies, some effects are observed such as inflammatory markers reduction and oxidative stress inhibition. Finally, limited and contradictory evidence is found regarding the effectiveness of antioxidants. There exist studies which suggest that some dietetic elements (polyunsaturated fatty acids, mediterranean diet and antioxidants) have anti-inflammatory effects and decrease AR disease activity. More studies are required to empower the results on those aspects where evidence is still non conclusive.

10325661	Comparative Study	To identify factors affecting prognosis in patients with late-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A total of 400 patients with RA fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis were prospectively recruited from two hospital rheumatology centres. Of these patients, 214 had disease onset above age 65 yr (LORA) and 186 below age 65 yr (YORA). Follow-up clinical, functional, laboratory and radiological assessments were compared. The Ritchie articular index (RAI) and joint erosions were used as markers of disease activity and damage, respectively. Disability was assessed using the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). At median follow-up of 3.6 yr, the frequency of joint erosions was similar (YORA, 51.6%; LORA, 54.2%). The remission rate was greater in the LORA group (YORA, 20.4%; LORA, 45.8%, P &lt; 0.01). Factors associated with the development of erosions were: IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositivity [odds ratio (OR) = 4.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.56, 6.94], HLA DR4 (OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.28, 3.35) and elevated inflammatory markers (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.04, 3.14). Continuous steroid use &gt;3 months for the LORA group was associated with increased erosions (OR = 4.09, 95% CI 1.81, 9.27). LORA patients (OR = 2.99, 95% CI 1.77, 5.02) were more likely to go into remission and IgM RF-seropositive patients less likely to go into clinical remission (OR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.28, 0.77). Female patients with a high HAQ score at presentation experienced a poor functional outcome (female OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.59, 5.68; high HAQ OR = 3.02, 95% CI 1.98, 4.62). LORA can be as damaging as classical RA and joint erosions are often observed at presentation. Being RF seropositive, DR4 positive, and having elevated inflammatory markers at onset, were associated with poor radiological outcome irrespective of age of onset. Being female and having marked disability at presentation were associated with poor functional outcome in both groups. These findings suggest that treatment approaches used in classical YORA should be instituted with equal vigour in patients with LORA.

3737493	Journal Article	Clinical criteria for diagnosis of osteoarthritis are not yet formally established; at present, diagnosis is usually made through physical and radiologic examination and evaluation of synovial fluid. Severe trauma and possibly repeated microtrauma, excessive activity, inactivity, and obesity are believed to aggravate symptoms. Treatment objectives are to reduce pain and improve, or at least preserve, function. Antiinflammatory agents provide relief for many patients, although gastrointestinal reactions may accompany their use. Antispasmodics may be helpful for pain caused by muscle spasm, and intraarticular injections of depocorticosteroids are useful for inflammation. Agents that provide analgesia are an appropriate part of the therapeutic program. Patients should be taught to protect weakened joints through use of orthotics, strengthening exercises, and proper body movement and posture. A supportive physician who encourages a healthy life-style and positive outlook will see better physical as well as emotional results with these patients.

7612046	Journal Article	To evaluate the efficacy of stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3 [MMP-3]) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) in serum as markers for joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Levels of both macromolecules in sera from 97 healthy controls, 109 patients with RA, and 47 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were measured by respective 1-step sandwich enzyme immunoassays. In the patients with RA, serum levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were investigated in relation to laboratory and clinical measures of disease activity. In addition, the relationships between serum and synovial fluid (SF) levels in paired samples from individual patients were examined. Serum levels of both MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in RA patients were significantly higher than those in OA patients and in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001), and were shown to correlate with traditional systemic markers of inflammation including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, and with the Lansbury articular index. In addition, it was noted that serum levels of MMP-3 correlated with the corresponding values in paired SF samples obtained concurrently from patients with RA (rs = 0.588, P &lt; 0.001), while such correlations were not found for TIMP-1 levels. Our results support the notion that levels of both MMP-3 and TIMP-1 in RA patient sera are increased in association with inflammation. Furthermore, the level of MMP-3 in serum provides a particularly useful marker of inflammatory activity in the joints of patients with RA.

11367869	Clinical Trial	The aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic value of adding a high dose of vitamin E or an antioxidant combination to the treatment regimen of the rheumatoid disease. The study was carried out on 30 patients with rheumatoid disease diagnosed according to the criteria of American Rheumatism Association (ARA), subvided into three equal groups. Patients in group I received a standard treatment of intramuscular methotrexate (CAS 59-05-2; 12.5 mg/week), oral sulphasalazine (CAS 599-79-1; 0.5 g b.i.d.) and indometacin (CAS 53-86-1; 100 mg suppository at bed-time). In group II the patients received the standard treatment plus a combination of antioxidants. Patients in group III received a high dose of vitamin E (400 mg t.i.d.) in addition to the standard treatment. The disease state was evaluated using Ritchle\&#39;s articular score index and the duration of morning stiffness. Laboratory evaluations included the rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), plasma levels of vitamin E and malonedialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). In the group receiving the standard regimen, the patients started to feel tangible improvement by the end of the second month. With adjuvant therapy of either the antioxidant combination or a high dose of vitamin E the symptoms of arthritis were better controlled from the first month. By the end of the second month, the values of the three monitoring tests were significantly decreased indicating better control of the disease. The percentage increase in the activity of GPx was highest in patients taking the antioxidant combination and least in those taking the standard treatment. The decrease in plasma MDA followed the same pattern. With adjuvant therapy, the vitamin E level in plasma increased with the duration of treatment. The results obtained in the present study are encouraging. The clinical improvement and the shift in the disease indices towards normal make the use of antioxidants as adjuvant therapy in rheumatoid disease worth pursuing.

24344049	Journal Article	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the possible therapeutic effects and the safety of Mangifera indica extract (Vimang tablets, 300 mg) combined with methotrexate (MTX) on reducing disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty patients with active RA underwent a year of treatment with MTX (12.5 mg/week) associated to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or prednisone (5-10 mg/day) were randomly allocated to the experimental group (n=10), that received the extract supplementation (900 mg/day) or preceding usual treatment (n=10) during 180 days. RA activity was evaluated using the tender and swollen joint counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, disease activity score-28 (DAS 28), visual analogue scale (VAS) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). Treatment\&#39;s efficacy was demonstrated with ACR criteria. Only the patients of MTX-Vimang group revealed statistically significant improvement in DAS 28 parameters with respect baseline data but no differences were observed between groups. ACR improvements amounted 80% only in MTX-Vimang group at the 90 days (p&lt;0.001). In MTX-Vimang group, 100% of patients decreased NSAIDs administration (p&lt;0.01) and 70% of those eradicated gastrointestinal side effects (p&lt;0.01) ensuing of the preceding treatment.

19332973	Journal Article	Continuing advances in the treatment of inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have made remission a realistic goal for patients. Despite these advances, early diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis by primary care physicians (PCPs) and subsequent referral to a rheumatologist remain a challenge. Delayed diagnosis and referral, which may extend to several years in some cases, may lead to irreversible joint destruction and compromised function. The aim of this review is to aid PCPs in preventing the potential delay in disease recognition and patient referral by highlighting the currently accepted criteria for disease activity, clinical response, and remission of RA, AS, and PsA. In addition, a discussion of the benefits and risks of the currently approved traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic treatments, and the importance of comanagement of these conditions across specialties, will be addressed. Because PCPs are often the first point of contact for disease recognition, they can play a critical role in the management of these patients.

21306034	Journal Article	In order to achieve remission, rapid diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a key priority. The new RA classification system allows a diagnosis to be made much earlier than previously. The criteria focus on clinical, biochemical and immunological features associated with persistent and/or erosive disease. Following presentation to primary care, patients with symptoms and signs of an inflammatory arthritis should be referred to a rheumatologist. Any patient with suspected persistent synovitis of undetermined cause should be referred for specialist opinion and urgent referral if any of the following apply: the small joints of the hands or feet are affected; &gt; 1 joint is affected; there has been a delay of &gt; 3 months between onset of symptoms and seeking medical advice. Early treatment results in a greater chance of inducing remission. Ideally, this should be within 6 weeks of symptom onset. Patients who develop severe persistent inflammatory arthritis who have normal investigations at disease onset should be referred regardless. Similarly, referral should not be delayed pending investigations. A fundamental shift in the approach to treating RA has occurred with the archaic \&#39;start low, go slow\&#39; management pyramid having been rejected. EULAR recommends initiating traditional DMARDs as soon as the diagnosis of RA is made, aiming to achieve the target of remission or low disease activity as rapidly as possible. Once prolonged and satisfactory levels of disease control have been achieved, drug doses may be cautiously reduced to levels that still maintain disease control. EULAR guidelines state that if the treatment target is not achieved following the first traditional DMARD strategy, in the presence of poor prognostic factors, or in patients responding insufficiently to DMARDs, then biologic therapy should be considered.

9106936	Clinical Trial	The aim of this study was to investigate if dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-supported magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can monitor the therapeutic effect of a fast-acting immuno-modulating drug like anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) monoclonal antibody (moab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dynamic MR imaging was performed on 64 joints in a total of 18 patients before and after infusion with either a placebo or 1 or 10 mg/kg of anti-TNF-alpha moab. Additionally, treating the placebo group and reinfusing the verum group with either 3 or 10 mg/kg was monitored by quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Time-dependent signal intensity changes were then correlated with a total of five Paulus criteria and with ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP). No changes in either the gadolinium uptake or clinical parameters were seen after the infusion of a placebo. Therapy with 1 mg/kg anti-TNF-alpha moab resulted in a significant decrease in clinical disease activity, as well as in gadolinium-DTPA uptake in dynamic NMR studies. However, correlations between singal intensity changes and Paulus criteria were only demonstrated for the variable \&quot;doctor\&#39;s evaluation of disease activity\&quot;. Patients given 10 mg/kg moab demonstrated a very significant improvement in all clinical manifestations of their disease, as well as a high significant reduction in gadolinium uptake (P = 0.004). In addition, the latter group showed significant correlations between time-dependent signal intensity changes and five Paulus criteria: \&quot;number of swollen joints\&quot;, \&quot;number of painful joints\&quot;, \&quot;duration of morning stiffness\&quot;, \&quot;doctor\&#39;s evaluation of disease activity\&quot; and \&quot;patient\&#39;s evaluation of disease activity\&quot;. No differences and correlations were seen for ESR and CRP. We concluded that dynamic NMR studies are suitable to monitor inflammatory activity in RA patients under therapy with biological response modifiers such as anti-TNF-alpha moab.

28967368	Journal Article	Cannabis has been used to treat pain for thousands of years. However, since the early part of the 20th century, laws restricting cannabis use have limited its evaluation using modern scientific criteria. Over the last decade, the situation has started to change because of the increased availability of cannabis in the United States for either medical or recreational purposes, making it important to provide the public with accurate information as to the effectiveness of the drug for joint pain among other indications. The major psychotropic component of cannabis is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of some 120 naturally occurring phytocannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) is another molecule found in herbal cannabis in large amounts. Although CBD does not produce psychotropic effects, it has been shown to produce a variety of pharmacological effects. Hence, the overall effects of herbal cannabis represent the collective activity of THC, CBD and a number of minor components. The action of THC is mediated by two major G-protein coupled receptors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) and CB2, and recent work has suggested that other targets may also exist. Arachidonic acid derived endocannabinoids are the normal physiological activators of the two cannabinoid receptors. Natural phytocannabinoids and synthetic derivatives have produced clear activity in a variety of models of joint pain in animals. These effects are the result of both inhibition of pain pathway signalling (mostly CB1) and anti-inflammatory effects (mostly CB2). There are also numerous anecdotal reports of the effectiveness of smoking cannabis for joint pain. Indeed, it is the largest medical request for the use of the drug. However, these reports generally do not extend to regulated clinical trials for rheumatic diseases. Nevertheless, the preclinical and human data that do exist indicate that the use of cannabis should be taken seriously as a potential treatment of joint pain.

20448286	Journal Article	To determine whether genetic variation within genes integral to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) and NFkappaB signalling systems, two cardinal regulators of inflammatory and immune responses, contributes towards the observed variation in response to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pairwise-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 24 candidate genes were selected and genotyped in a large UK cohort of patients receiving anti-TNF therapy for RA. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to test association between individual genotypes, under an additive model, and treatment response at 6 months\&#39; follow-up assessed using both the absolute change in 28-joint count Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Analyses were performed across subgroups comprising etanercept-, infliximab- and infliximab/adalimumab-treated patients as well as the combined anti-TNF-treated cohort. p Values &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant. A total of 187 SNPs were successfully genotyped and analysed in 909 patients. Eight SNPs spanning six genes demonstrated nominal evidence of association with response (DAS28) across the anti-TNF-treated subgroups, six of which were restricted to etanercept-treated patients. Twelve SNPs spanning nine genes demonstrated nominal evidence of association with treatment response (DAS28 and/or EULAR) across the combined anti-TNF cohort. These included SNPs mapping to MyD88 (rs7744) and CHUK (rs11591741), which were associated under each model applied (etanercept-treated and combined anti-TNF cohort analysis (DAS28 and EULAR)). Several SNPs mapping to the TLR and NFkappaB signalling systems demonstrated association with anti-TNF response as a whole and, in particular, with response to etanercept. Validation of these findings in an independent cohort is now warranted.

3704514	English Abstract	Three groups of subjects were selected for this study. Patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosed according to the criteria of the ARA (mean: 6 criteria) and treated with gold salts. Control subjects treated with one type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (diclofenac). Healthy subjects receiving no treatment. The granulocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood were tested separately for the ingestion of 3 types of particles and for the stimulation of the production of the superoxide anion. In the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, all of the phagocytic cells had a normal phagocytic response and a normal superoxide anion production. The serum of the patients did not inhibit the activity of these cells. Diclofenac did not act on phagocytosis or on the oxidative activity of the control cells. It is therefore logical to consider that the phagocytic cells are involved in RA via other mechanisms of action.

19951408	Clinical Trial, Phase III	Chicken type II collagen (CCII) is a protein extracted from the cartilage of chicken breast and exhibits intriguing possibilities for the treatment of autoimmune diseases by inducing oral tolerance. A 24-week, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, methotrexate (MTX)-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CCII in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Five hundred three RA patients were included in the study. Patients received either 0.1 mg daily of CCII (n = 326) or 10 mg once a week of MTX (n = 177) for 24 weeks. Each patient was evaluated for pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count, swollen joint count, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), assessments by investigator and patient, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) by using the standard tools at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 12 and 24. Additionally, rheumatoid factor (RF) was evaluated at weeks 0 and 24. Measurement of a battery of biochemical parameters in serum, hematological parameters, and urine analysis was performed to evaluate the safety of CCII. Four hundred fifty-four patients (94.43%) completed the 24-week follow-up. In both groups, there were decreases in pain, morning stiffness, tender joint count, swollen joint count, HAQ, and assessments by investigator and patient, and all differences were statistically significant. In the MTX group, ESR and CRP decreased. RF did not change in either group. At 24 weeks, 41.55% of patients in the CCII group and 57.86% in the MTX group met the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (ACR-20) and 16.89% and 30.82%, respectively, met the ACR 50% improvement criteria (ACR-50). Both response rates for ACR-20 and ACR-50 in the CCII group were lower than those of the MTX group, and this difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). The DAS28 (disease activity score using 28 joint counts) values of the two treatment groups were calculated, and there was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05). Gastrointestinal complaints were common in both groups, but there were fewer and milder side effects in the CCII group than in the MTX group. The incidence of adverse events between the two groups was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05). CCII is effective in the treatment of RA and is safe for human consumption. CCII exerts its beneficial effects by controlling inflammatory responses through inducing oral tolerance in RA patients.  ChiCTR-TRC-00000093.

12759288	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a genetically complex disease where the response to different treatments varies greatly between different patients. This is the case with the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blocking agents, where 20-40% of patients have been described as non-responders. No predictive markers exist as yet for the prognosis of response. To analyse whether polymorphisms of several cytokine genes are associated with the responsiveness to TNF blockade with etanercept. 123 patients with active RA were treated with etanercept and response rates were determined after three months using American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 and disease activity score (DAS)28 response criteria. Genotyping was done for TNF (-308 TNFA), interleukin (IL)10 (-1087 IL10), transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (codon 25 TGFB1), and IL1 receptor antagonist (intron 2 IL1RN). 24 patients (20%) were defined as non-responders owing to their failure to fulfil any of the ACR20 or DAS28 response criteria. None of the recorded alleles was alone significantly associated with responsiveness to treatment. However, a certain combination of alleles (-308 TNF1/TNF1 and -1087 G/G) was associated with good responsiveness to etanercept (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a combination of alleles influencing interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1Ra) and TGFbeta1 production (A2 allele for IL1RN and rare C allele in codon 25 of TGFB1 gene) was associated with non-responsiveness (p&lt;0.05). Genetic polymorphisms, which may influence the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines of relevance for the course of RA, are associated with clinical responsiveness to etanercept treatment.

29556750	Journal Article	The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interactive digital interventions (IDIs) for physical activity (PA) and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with Inflammatory Arthritis [rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) axial Spondyloarthritis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA)]. Seven electronic databases identified published and unpublished studies. Two reviewers conducted independent data extraction and quality assessment using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB). The primary outcome was change in objective PA after the intervention; secondary outcomes included self-reported PA and HRQoL after the intervention and objective or self-reported PA at least 1 year later. Five manuscripts, reporting four RCTs (three high and one low RoB) representing 492 (459 RA, 33 JIA) participants were included. No trials studying PsA or AS met the inclusion criteria. Interventions ranged from 6 to 52 weeks and included 3-18 Behaviour Change Techniques. Due to heterogeneity of outcomes, a narrative synthesis was conducted. No trials reported any significant between group differences in objective PA at end of intervention. Only one low RoB trial found a significant between group difference in self-reported vigorous [MD Δ 0.9 days (95% CI 0.3, 1.5); p = 0.004], but not moderate, PA in people with RA but not JIA. There were no between group differences in any other secondary outcomes. There is very limited evidence for the effectiveness of IDIs on PA and HRQoL in RA and JIA and no evidence for their effectiveness in PsA or AS.

15989000	Clinical Trial	To study therapeutic potential of a novel basic drug leflunomide in suppression of activity and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Leflunomide efficacy was investigated in a 36 month trial including 50 patients with moderate and high activity RA. Monthly registrations were made of the articular syndrome quantitative parameters (Richi\&#39;s index, number of painful and swollen joints, severity of pain and general condition of the patient), morning stiffness duration, ESR, CRP, RF. Leflunomide efficacy was assessed by EULAR and ACR criteria. Dynamics of the extrajoint manifestations observed in 70% patients before therapy were examined clinically and by device tests. Speed of progression of erosive arthritis was quantified by a modified Sharp\&#39;s method in hand and foot joints, carpal bones each 6 months. Arava tolerance was controlled clinically and by laboratory tests. Leflunomide was found effective in 94% RA patients. A rapid (within the first month) and significant improvement in parameters of articular syndrome and CRP level was observed. To month 4 of therapy 1/5 patients achieved remission by EULAR criteria, to month 12--1/3 patients. By ACR criteria, 6-month leflunomide treatment produced good and exellent results in 71% patients which persisted up to the 36th month of therapy. The effect was better in shorter history of RA, moderate RA, in the absence of osteolyses and ankyloses. Leflunomide significantly reduced RF concentration in the serum, suppressed extrajoint RA manifestations (except Sjogren\&#39;s syndrome). The mean number of new joint erosions for 6 consecutive months was 2.93 +/- 3.2, 1.41 +/- 1.8, 0.78 +/- 2.0 (median 0), while progression coefficient corresponded to slow progression to the treatment month 18. No new erosions occurred after 12 months of arava treatment in 41% patients and after 18 months--in 62%. Leflunomide is well tolerated. The drug was discontinued because of cutaneous pruritus and diarrhea in 5 and 1 patients, respectively.

19187557	Journal Article	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a slowly destructive process that may be influenced by a nutritional mineral balance in the body. This small, double blind, placebo controlled pilot study investigated the impact of treatment with a natural multi-mineral supplement from seaweed (Aquamin) on 6 minute walking distance (6 MWD), range of motion (ROM), and pain and joint mobility measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index in subjects with moderate to severe OA of the knee during gradual withdrawal of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that were being used daily for pain management. Subjects (n = 29) with moderate to severe OA of the knee were randomised to receive either Aquamin (2400 mg/d) or Placebo for up to 12 weeks. Of the 29 subjects initially randomized, only 22 subjects proceeded to treatment due to 7 subjects not meeting study selection criteria at baseline. Fourteen subjects completed the study and an ITT analysis (n = 22) of the data showed no significant differences in WOMAC scores however, the data did reveal significant improvements in passive and active extension ROM (0.83 degrees +/- 1.54 vs. -1.54 degrees +/- 2.43; difference, 5.2 degrees +/- 2.2, p = 0.028) and 6 MWD (150 +/- 48 ft vs. 12.5 +/- 31.5 ft; difference, 136 +/- 57 ft, p = 0.03) in the Aquamin group compared to the placebo group; respectively, following a 50% reduction in NSAID use. The treatments were well tolerated and the adverse event profiles were not significantly different between the groups. This small preliminary study suggests Aquamin may increase range of motion and walking distances in subjects with OA of the knee and may allow partial withdrawal of NSAIDs over 12 weeks of treatment. Additional research is needed to confirm these preliminary observations. NCT00755482.

11735348	Journal Article	Rheumatic diseases are the most prevalent causes of disability in western countries, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are still the most commonly used remedies. However, NSAIDs cause several serious adverse effects, the most important being from gastric injury to gastric ulceration and renal damage. Attempts to develop non-steroidal anti-inflammatory remedies devoid of these shortcomings-especially gastrointestinal toxicity-have followed several strategies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have, therefore, been associated with gastroprotective agents that counteract the damaging effects of prostaglandin synthesis suppression; however, a combination therapy introduces other problems of pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and patient\&#39;s compliance. More recently, incorporation of a nitric oxide (NO)-generating moiety into the molecule of several NSAIDs was shown to greatly attenuate their ulcerogenic activity; however, several findings suggest a possible involvement of NO in the pathogenesis of arthritis and subsequent tissue destruction. A most promising approach seemed to be the preparation of novel NSAIDs, targeted at the inducible isoform of prostaglandin synthase (COX-2); they appear to be devoid of gastrointestinal toxicity, in that they spare mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. However, a number of recent studies have raised serious questions about the two central tenets that support this approach, namely that the prostaglandins that mediate inflammation and pain are produced solely via COX-2 and that the prostaglandins that are important in gastrointestinal and renal function are produced solely via COX-1. So, a growing body of evidence shows that COX-2 (not only COX-1) also plays a physiological role in several body functions and that, conversely, COX-1 (not only COX-2) may also be induced at sites of inflammation. More recent and puzzling data shows that COX-2 is induced during the resolution of an inflammatory response, and at this point it produces anti-inflammatory (PGD2 and PGF2alpha), but not proinflammatory (PGE2) prostaglandins; inhibition of COX-2 at this point thus results in persistence of the inflammation. Moreover, COX-2 selective NSAIDs have lost the cardiovascular protective effects of non-selective NSAIDs, effects which are mediated through COX-1 inhibition (in addition, COX-2 has a role in sustaining vascular prostacyclin production). The generation of other very important products of the arachidonic acid cascade (besides cyclooxygenase-produced metabolites) is inhibited neither by non-selective nor by COX-2 selective NSAIDs. The products generated by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway (leukotrienes) are particularly important in inflammation; indeed, leukotrienes increase microvascular permeability and are potent chemotactic agents. Moreover, inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase indirectly reduces the expression of TNF-alpha (a cytokine that plays a key role in inflammation). These data and considerations explain the efforts to obtain drugs able to inhibit both 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenases, the so-called dual acting anti-inflammatory drugs. Such compounds retain the activity of classical NSAIDs, while avoiding their main drawbacks, in that curtailed production of gastroprotective prostaglandins is associated with a concurrent curtailed production of the gastro-damaging and bronchoconstrictive leukotrienes. Moreover, thanks to their mechanism of action, dual acting anti-inflammatory drugs could not merely alleviate symptoms of rheumatic diseases, but might also satisfy, at least in part, the criteria of a more definitive treatment. Indeed, leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory, increase microvascular permeability, are potent chemotactic agents and attract eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes into the synovium.

28610655	Journal Article	Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome is one of the more common inflammatory rheumatological diseases, with a prevalence of at least 0.4% in Germany. This review is based on pertinent articles retrieved by a selective search in PubMed. Special attention is drawn to updated classification criteria and current treatment recommendations. Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome has a wide variety of presentations, ranging from the local involvement of exocrine glands with keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia (the leading signs of the disease) to the systemic, extraglandular involvement of multiple organs. Fatigue also markedly worsens the patients\&#39; quality of life. Serologic testing reveals antinuclear auto-antibodies (anti-Ro/ SSA and anti-La/SSB) as well as rheumatoid factors. The histological hallmark of the disease is focal lymphocytic infiltration in otherwise normal-appearing glandular acini. The disease also markedly elevates the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the B-cell series, which arises in about 5% of patients. Primary Sjögren\&#39;s syndrome (pSS) differs from the secondary form (sSS), which appears in the setting of another autoimmune disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (15-36%), rheumatoid arthritis (20-32%), and limited or progressive systemic sclerosis (11-24%). Disease-modifying therapy is reserved for patients with systemic involvement; there is limited evidence for its efficacy. Because of the complexity of this disease, some of its clinical manifestations may require interdisciplinary treatment. The main considerations in the interdisciplinary care of patients with Sjögren\&#39;s disease are measures to improve quality of life, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments to keep disease activity in check, and management of the risk of lymphoma. Future therapeutic approaches must take the heterogeneity of the disease into account.

10952744	Journal Article	To evaluate the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) in the assessment of functional status, its responsiveness to change with treatment and its correlation with conventional disease activity indices in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Newly diagnosed patients with PMR, satisfying modified Jones and Hazleman criteria, were recruited to the study. The clinical assessments, including early morning stiffness (EMS), pain measured on a horizontal 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the HAQ, were carried out 0, 6, 12 and 24 weeks after treatment had been started. Any comorbid condition likely to affect the HAQ was noted. Eighteen patients completed the 6-month assessment period. These included four males and 14 females, with a mean age of 68.5 years. Pretreatment mean disease activity showed EMS of 68 min, VAS pain of 69 mm, CRP of 46 mg/l and a HAQ score of 1.57. At 6 months, mean EMS had declined to 4 min, VAS pain to 11 mm, CRP to 9 mg/l and the HAQ score to 0.14. Linear regression analysis of HAQ vs EMS, VAS and CRP showed correlation coefficients of 0.72, 0.66 and 0.63, respectively. Standardized response means (SRM), a measure of responsiveness, for HAQ, EMS, VAS and CRP were 3, 1.7, 1. 8 and 1.6, respectively. We assessed each section of the HAQ individually to see if any particular daily activity was more responsive to change. Questions on dressing and grooming, rising and eating were more responsive to change (SRM 2.5, 2.7 and 1.8, respectively) than questions about walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities (SRM 0.8, 1.4, 1.2, 1.1 and 1.1, respectively). The HAQ is useful in the assessment of functional status in PMR, is responsive to change and correlates well with conventional indices of disease activity. However, fixed disabilities like osteoarthritis, shoulder capsulitis and systemic diseases may affect its interpretation. The sections of the HAQ measuring disability related to inflammatory stiffness/proximal involvement showed greater responsiveness to change than other sections, and hence may have a greater role in evaluating disease activity in PMR.

27974097	Comparative Study	The aim of this study was to compare the 12-month probability of remission in early inflammatory arthritis with a milder treatment based on the 1987 criteria or a more intensive protocol based on the 2010 criteria. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or undifferentiated arthritis (UA) (2005-2012) were included. Before October 2010, patients fulfilling the 1987 criteria received methotrexate (MTX) and possibly low-dose prednisone, while UA hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (1987-driven cohort). From October 2010, patients fulfilling the 2010 criteria received higher dose MTX and low-dose prednisone, while UA HCQ (2010-driven cohort). Treatment was increased to achieve DAS28 low disease activity. Clinical remission, defined by DAS28, was evaluated at subsequent visits in the whole population. Hazard ratios (HR) adjusted for age, sex, baseline DAS28, symptoms duration, MTX dose and prednisone were calculated by Cox regression. 677 patients were included (468 in 1987-driven cohort, 209 in 2010-driven cohort), with no significant differences in age, gender, autoantibodies and pain. The 2010-driven cohort had significantly fewer tender and swollen joints, lower acute phase reactants, DAS28 and HAQ and achieved more frequently remission even when the analysis was adjusted for all confounders (adjusted HR (95% CI) 1.73 (1.34, 2.22)) and limited to per protocol patients (adjusted HR (95%CI) 1.49 (1.11, 2.02). Treating patients with early arthritis according to a more intensive protocol leads to higher remission rate. The results of this study support the use of a strategy led by the 2010 criteria with more intensive treatment strategies in the management of early arthritis.

10580457	Clinical Trial	In vitro studies have shown that celecoxib inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) but not COX-1, suggesting that this drug may have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity without adverse upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract effects that result from COX-1 inhibition. To test whether celecoxib has efficacy as an anti-inflammatory and analgesic with reduced GI tract mucosal damage compared with conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial lasting 12 weeks, with follow-up at weeks 2, 6, and 12, from September 1996 thorugh February 1998. Seventy-nine clinical sites in the United States and Canada. A total of 1149 patients aged 18 years or older with symptomatic rheumatoid arthritis who met inclusion criteria were randomized; 688 (60%) of these completed the study. Patients were randomized to receive celecoxib, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg twice per day (n = 240, 235, and 218, respectively); naproxen, 500 mg twice per day (n = 225); or placebo (n = 231). Improvement in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis as assessed using standard measures of efficacy and GI tract safety as assessed by upper GI tract endoscopy before and after treatment, compared among treatment groups. All dosages of celecoxib and naproxen significantly improved the signs and symptoms of arthritis compared with placebo. Maximal anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity was evident within 2 weeks of initiating treatment and was sustained throughout the 12 weeks. The incidence of endoscopically determined gastroduodenal ulcers in placebo-treated patients was 4 (4%) of 99, and the incidences across all dosages of celecoxib were not significantly different (P&gt;.40): 9 (6%) of 148 with 100 mg twice per day, 6 (4%) of 145 with 200 mg twice per day, and 8 (6%) of 130 with 400 mg twice per day. In contrast, the incidence with naproxen was 36 (26%) of 137, significantly greater than either placebo or celecoxib (P&lt;.001). The overall incidences of GI tract adverse effects were 19% for placebo; 28%, 25%, and 26% for celecoxib 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg twice per day, respectively; and 31 % for naproxen. In this study, all dosages of celecoxib were efficacious in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and did not affect COX-1 activity in the GI tract mucosa as evidenced by less frequent incidence of endoscopic ulcers compared with naproxen.

21107634	Journal Article	To determine the efficacy and safety of single-dose mizoribine (MZR) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a 6-month, single-arm, open-label, prospective observation study was performed. In patients who had been taking MZR at 100-150 mg/day in 2-3 divided portions continuously for at least 3 months, and who had shown a lack of clinical response, or escape (defined as a lack of response at the time of switching, even if some form of response had been shown before that), multiple-dose administration was switched to single-dose administration without changing the total daily dose. Efficacy was assessed in terms of the disease activity score, using the 28-joint count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS 28-ESR). Of the 34 enrolled patients, 28 met all the eligibility criteria and were assessed for efficacy, and finally 26 patients were able to receive the single-dose regimen throughout the full 6 months. The DAS28-ESR showed a significant decrease from 2 months after switching, and 46.4% of the 28 patients finally achieved a good or moderate response (3 and 10 patients, respectively). With regard to safety, no serious adverse events were observed. In conclusion, the administration of MZR at 100 or 150 mg in a single dose is thought to be a useful alternative form of MZR therapy.

28367663	Journal Article	To assess what proportion of patients with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)-naïve early rheumatoid arthritis (ERA) reach 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) remission over 1 year, and remission variability across clinics in Finland. Patients with DMARD-naïve newly diagnosed inflammatory arthritis were recruited. The proportion of patients in 28-joint Disease Activity Score with three variables (DAS28-3) remission was compared across sites. Repeated measures were analysed using a mixed models approach with appropriate distribution and link function. In total, 611 patients were recruited at five sites: 67% were female; the mean (sd) age was 57 (16) years; 71% and 68% were positive for rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides, respectively; and 23% had radiographic erosions. A total of 506 (83%) fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis for further analyses. DAS28-3 remission was met by 68% and 75% at 3 and 12 months, respectively. The clinical site had no effect on remission when adjusted for confounders. At baseline, 68% used methotrexate-based combination therapy, and 31% used triple therapy with methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and sulphasalazine (the Fin-RACo regimen). In multivariate analysis, the only independent predictors of DAS28-3 remission at 12 months were lower baseline DAS28-3 and triple therapy as the initial treatment. Three out of four DMARD-naïve ERA patients in Finland are in remission during the first year from the diagnosis. High remission rates were achieved for most patients with the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs in combination. Treatment of DMARD-naïve ERA patients with the FIN-RACo regimen is a predictor of DAS28-3 remission in real-life rheumatology settings.

16465650	Clinical Trial	To investigate the clinical response and to evaluate by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the inflammatory tissue changes in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with adalimumab. Thirteen patients with refractory RA who were treated with adalimumab (40 mg every 2 weeks subcutaneously) were examined with MRI of the dominant affected wrist and hand before treatment and one year after therapy. The volume of the enhanced inflammatory tissue (VEIT) was evaluated in fat-suppressed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI images using the Analyse 4.0 software. Disease activity was evaluated using the Disease Activity Score 28-joint (DAS-28). Clinical improvement was evaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20%). We studied 12 women and one man, with mean age 52.0 +/- 10.9 years and mean disease duration 13.0 +/- 8.5 years. Eight patients had positive IgM rheumatoid factor. One year after treatment, 11 (84.6%) patients showed a decrease of the VEIT. Moreover the values of C-reactive protein (CRP; 4.3 +/- 6.6 mg/l), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 26.3 +/- 19.5 mm/h), the DAS-28 (3.5 +/- 1.1), and the VEIT (21.6 +/- 10.7 cm3) after treatment were significantly lower compared to the corresponding values before treatment (CRP 41.6 +/- 39.2), (ESR 54.3 +/- 28.6) (DAS-28 5.8 +/- 0.8), and (VEIT 36.9 +/- 16.8) (p &lt; 0.01). All but 3 (76.9%) patients with RA achieved the ACR20% response, while 7 (53.8%) and 5 (38.5%) patients achieved ACR50% and ACR70% response, respectively. A positive correlation between VEIT, swollen joint count, and ESR was found before treatment (r = 0.59, r = 0.64, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). In patients with refractory RA, treatment with adalimumab resulted in improvement of clinical, laboratory, and MRI findings. MRI assessment of the VEIT may represent an additional tool for investigation of joint disease activity and responsiveness to treatment.

Randomised controlled trials (RCT\&#39;s) evaluating patient education interventions that included an instructional component and a non-intervention control group; pre- and post-test results available separately for RA, either in the publication or from the studies\&#39; authors; and study results presented in full, end-of-study report. Thirty-one studies with relevant data were included. We found significant effects of patient education at first follow-up for scores on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status, and depression. A trend favouring patient education was found for scores on pain. Physician global assessment was not assessed in any of the included studies. The dimensions of anxiety and disease activity showed no significant effects. At final follow up no significant effects of patient education were found, although there was a trend favouring patient education for scores on disability. Patient education as provided in the studies reviewed here had small short-term effects on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment, psychological status and depression. There was no evidence of long-term benefits in adults with rheumatoid arthritis.

18346273	Clinical Trial	High-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1) has recently been identified as an endogenous mediator of arthritis. TNF and IL-1beta, pivotal cytokines in arthritis pathogenesis, both have the ability to induce the release of HMGB1 from myeloid and dendritic cells. It was, therefore, decided to investigate whether treatment based on TNF blockade in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects the expression of synovial HMGB1. Repeated arthroscopy-guided sampling of synovial tissue was performed in nine patients with RA before and nine weeks after initiation of anti-TNF mAb (infliximab) therapy. Synovial biopsy specimens were analysed for HMGB1 protein by immunohistochemical staining and for HMGB1 mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Statistical evaluations were based on Wilcoxon\&#39;s signed rank tests or Spearman rank sum tests. Aberrant, extranuclear HMGB1 and constitutive nuclear HMGB1 expression, with histological signs of inflammation, were evident in all biopsies obtained before infliximab therapy. Signs of inflammation were still evident in the second biopsies obtained nine weeks after initiation of infliximab therapy. The cytoplasmic and extracellular expression of HMGB1 decreased in five patients, remained unchanged in one patient and increased in three patients, making the overall change in HMGB1 protein expression not significant. No correlation between the clinical response, as measured by disease activity score calculated for 28 joints (DAS28) or the American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR 20, 50, and 70), and the direction of change of HMGB1 expression in individual patients could be discerned. In addition, infliximab therapy did not alter HMGB1 mRNA synthesis. Pro-inflammatory HMGB1 expression during rheumatoid synovitis was not consistently influenced by TNF-blocking therapy with infliximab. This suggests that TNF is not the main inducer of extranuclear HMGB1 during synovitis and that HMGB1 may represent a TNF-independent molecule that could be considered as a possible target for future therapeutic intervention in RA.

10531077	Clinical Trial	To study benefits and skeletal side effects of carefully monitored prednisolone treatment in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. One hundred and two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to treatment with disease modifying anti-inflammatory drug (DMARD) alone or DMARD and prednisolone in a one year follow up study. Prednisolone was given in a dose regimen adapted to the disease activity of the individual patient. The mean dose was 6 mg and the mean cumulated dose was 2160 mg. Patients were followed up with disease activity parameters, radiograph of the hands (Larsen score), and bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine, distal forearm and hand. At one year 26 patients had withdrawn from the investigation leaving 76 patients for evaluation. The results showed that disease activity in the prednisolone treated group was reduced within two weeks. In the DMARD alone group disease activity was gradually reduced over months. At six months there was no difference between the groups as evaluated by an improvement score using a number of ACR criteria. Prednisolone in the present set up was not able to protect significantly against radiological disease progression, although there was a trend towards less progression in Larsen score in the prednisolone group, a matter that was further underlined in an intention to treat analysis. BMD data revealed a significant reduction in spinal BMD in the prednisolone group, whereas prednisolone seemed to have a protective effect against bone loss in the hand and distal forearm. This study does not allow any firm conclusions for or against the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with prednisolone. The data suggest that the beneficial effects of prednisolone are not as clear cut in established rheumatoid arthritis as in early disease. Furthermore the data indicate that treatment in the chosen relatively low dose does not provide sufficient control of disease. On the other hand the spinal bone loss observed in the prednisolone group does invite considerations about using higher doses.

27701693	Journal Article	New studies increase the evidence, that different applications of physical therapy are effective. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) physiotherapy of the hands improve strength, joint mobility and activity without increased risk of pain nor inflammation. A theory-based physiotherapy of the hands shows clinical effectiveness and cost-utility. In patients with spondyloarthritides supervised group exercise training is more effective than home exercise programs. Compared with biologics only combined exercise training and tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor therapy improve mobility and disease activity more effectively. Aerobic exercise training reduces fatigue in RA. Working wrist splints and static resting splints improve pain and grip strength. Static resting splints reduce the risk of hand deformities. Local and whole body cryotherapy show short term improvement of pain and inflammatory activity. German S3-guidelines recommend enhanced utilisation of physical therapy as well as coordinated multiprofessional team care and rehabilitation.

10796400	Journal Article	To estimate the short-term efficacy and toxicity of sulfasalazine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group trials register, and Medline, up to July 1997, using the search strategy developed by the Cochrane Collaboration (Dickersin 1994). The search was complemented with bibliography searching of the reference list of the trials retrieved from the electronic search. Key experts in the area were contacted for further published and unpublished articles. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing sulfasalazine against placebo in patients with RA. Two reviewers determined the studies to be included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria (GW, MSA). Data were independently abstracted by two reviewers (EB, MSA), and checked by a third reviewer (BS) using a pre-developed form for the rheumatoid arthritis sub-group of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group. The same two reviewers, using a validated scale (Jadad 1996) assessed the methodological quality of the RCTs and CCTs independently. Rheumatoid arthritis outcome measures were extracted from the publications. The pooled analysis was performed using standardized mean differences (SMDs) for joint counts, pain, and global and functional assessments. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were used for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Toxicity was evaluated with pooled odds ratios (OR) for withdrawals. A chi-square test was used to assess heterogeneity among trials. Fixed effects models were used throughout and random effects for outcomes showing heterogeneity. Six trials, including 468 patients were included. A statistically significant benefit was observed for sulfasalazine when compared to placebo for tender and swollen joint scores, pain and ESR. The standardized weighted mean difference between treatment and placebo was -0.49 for tender and swollen joint scores, and -0.42 for pain. The difference for ESR was -17.6mm. Withdrawals from adverse reactions were significantly higher in the sulfasalazine group (OR=3.0). Patients receiving placebo were four times more likely to discontinue treatment because of lack of efficacy than patients receiving sulfasalazine. Sulfasalazine appears to have a clinically and statistically significant benefit on the disease activity of patients with RA. Its effects on overall health status and radiological progression are not clear at this time, but would appear to be modest.

1094038	Clinical Trial	The safety and effectiveness of tolmetin was assessed in ten patients with active rheumatoid arthritis for 12 months. All patients met the requirements of the American Rheumatism Association\&#39;s diagnostic criteria for definite rheumatoid arthritis. None of the patients had received gold, antimalarials, or glucocorticoids. All had been stabilized, more or less, with aspirin. Monthly measurements were made of grip strength, duration of morning stiffness, time to the onset of fatigue, Westergren sedimentation rates, the number of swollen joints, number of hot joints, the time to walk 50 feet, and the circumference of proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints (measured in millimeters with a plastic-loop arthrocircameter). The initial dosage of tolmetin in all patients was 600 mg a day, given orally in three divided doses. Upon completion of the study, the average daily oral dosage was 1400 mg tolmetin. No other antiinflammatory drugs were allowed. The results indicate that tolmetin affords symptomatic relief of rheumatoid arthritis; its use results in global improvement in 80 per cent of the patients, and a net improvement in one or more of the parameters used to assess disease activity in 100 per cent of the patients; it seems to be sufficiently safe to administer to patients over a long period of time; there was no evidence of severe toxicity of any kind; gastrointestinal side effects were uncommon, and epigastric distress, in particular, was not observed.

14705217	Journal Article	To assess the criteria for remission based on Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) and DAS28-3 (excluding patients\&#39; evaluation of disease activity) compared to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) preliminary criteria in established rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and to examine the value of each ACR criterion individually. The EMECAR study was designed to assess the burden of comorbidity and inflammatory activity for RA in Spain. A random sample of 788 patients with RA from 34 Spanish centers was selected. Remission was defined by preliminary ACR criteria applied specifically and the clinical activity assessed by the DAS28 and the DAS28-3. A receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was performed to identify cutoff values with the highest usefulness in defining remission on both DAS indices. Thirty-two patients (4.1%) were in ACR-defined remission, 62 (7.9%) if fatigue was excluded from the criteria. The frequency of any single criterion that patients in remission fulfilled: no fatigue and joint pain by anamnesis in 31 patients (96.9%); morning stiffness &lt; 15 min in 26 (81.3%); no swelling in joints in 21 (65.6%); normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 29 (90.6%); and no joint tenderness in 21 (65.6%) patients. The positive predictive value for remission of each criterion: normal ESR 6.5%; morning stiffness &lt; 15 min 8.4%; no fatigue 8.7%; no joint tenderness 13%; no swelling in joints 15.8%; and no joint pain by anamnesis 27.7%. The DAS28 cutoff values with higher discriminatory power for remission were 3.14 (sensitivity 87%; specificity 67%) when all the ACR criteria were used, and 2.81 (sensitivity 84%; specificity 81%) when fatigue was omitted. The equivalent cutoffs for the DAS28-3 were 3.52 (sensitivity 84%; specificity 66%) and 2.95 (sensitivity 82%; specificity 83%), respectively. DAS28 and DAS28-3 are good tools to define remission in established RA. No joint pain by anamnesis is the criterion with the highest value in defining remission, while normal ESR, an absence of morning stiffness, and fatigue are the least effective.

15733011	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory disease that affects approximately 0.5-1% of the adult population. The introduction of new disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as leflunomide, anakinra and the tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonists (infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab) have transformed the management of RA. In particular, the last class of agents has generated substantial controversy. Costing between 16,000 US dollars and 20,000 US dollars per patient-year (2001 values), the potential greater efficacy of treatment with TNFalpha antagonists comes at much higher drug costs, making these agents natural candidates for cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs).A MEDLINE search (until 31 January 2004) identified six original CEAs evaluating TNFalpha antagonists in RA. The aim of a CEA is to facilitate the allocation of scarce health resources and to inform policy decisions. However, to enhance the reliability and relevance of these analyses to policy makers, there must be similarity between the methodologies used. Recently, the OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials) group produced a document to define such a reference case; the OMERACT document was used as a foundation to structure comparisons and highlight discrepancies. The methodologies employed in each analysis differed; in particular, disparate time horizons, comparators, quantities of drug and treatment sequences prohibit the comparison of cost effectiveness between studies. Outcomes also differed between the analyses. Most reported health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The QALYs metric was based on preference scores that were typically derived from linear regressions using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). However, models also used American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, as well as the disease activity score (DAS). Common to all studies was the lack of data from long-term randomised studies where efficacy and resource consumption in comparison with standard care has been investigated. As such, investigators combined short-term randomised control trial data with that of a long-term observational cohort, and modelled cost effectiveness over an appropriate time horizon. In addition, most analyses lacked rigorous sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of uncertainty in the parameters. Those analyses that examined time horizons of 6 months and 1 year published incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 34,800 US dollars per ACR 70% response criteria (ACR70) weighted response (duration 6 months, 1999 values) and 96,166 US dollars (duration 1 year, 2002 values). Analyses that modelled costs and health outcomes beyond the first year reported ICER estimates ranging between 26,800 US dollars (patients\&#39; lifetime, 1998 values) and 40,308 US dollars (10 years, 2002 values). In terms of HR-QOL, the analyses reported incremental QALYs that ranged from 0.116 (over 19 years) to 1.6 (over 10 years). Discounted costs of therapy ranged from 30,362 US dollars (10 years, 2002 values) to 93,000 US dollars (22 years, 1998 values), and comparator costs ranged from 22,593 US dollars (10 years, 2002 values) to 84,000 US dollars (22 years, 1998 values).

10606361	Clinical Trial	To assess the additional benefit of synacthen depot over standard inpatient care for patients hospitalized with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). All patients admitted to our unit with active RA without exclusion criteria were invited to participate and randomized to subcutaneous synacthen depot 0.5 mg on alternate days for 2 injections or 2 injections of saline. Patients, staff, and assessors of response were blinded to the intervention. Assessment [OMERACT set, American College of Rheumatology (ACR) global improvement, dose of intraarticular (IA) or intramuscular (IM) methylprednisolone] was performed at admission to hospital, at discharge, and at 3 and 6 months. Oral prednisone use constituted a protocol violation. Of 137 patients with RA admitted over the period of recruitment, 36 (26%) were enrolled; 31 completed followup. There were no between-group differences in the change from admission of any individual disease activity measure at any time point. However, using a rigorous global response measure (ACR 50%), a difference was detected in favor of synacthen depot at discharge (52.6% of the intervention group improved vs. 17.6% of controls; p = 0.029, number-needed-to-treat 2.86). Patients treated with synacthen depot showed a trend toward more IA or IM corticosteroid between discharge and 3 months (mean dose 56 vs. 31 mg; p = 0.19) and a trend toward more patients requiring a change in slow acting antirheumatic drug after discharge (4 vs. 1; p = 0.27). There is some additional benefit of synacthen depot in the hospital treatment of RA, but the effect is lost by 3 months, with a suggestion of rebound worsening in these patients. We postulate that oversuppression of corticotrophin releasing hormone by exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone in patients who already have a hypothalamic deficit may contribute to the rebound worsening of disease activity seen in these patients.

16892137	Clinical Trial	To examine the clinical benefit and impact on cytokine production by methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty patients with RA were treated with oral methotrexate (mean, 15 mg per week) as monotherapy for 24 weeks. Clinical assessment using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for improvement was performed at baseline and at the end of 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. The pro-inflammation cytokine TNF-alpha, INF-gamma,IL-1beta, IL-6 and anti-inflammation cytokine IL-10 were measured in RA sera at baseline and after 24 weeks of therapy. There was remarkable improvement in disease activity following the MTX treatment. At the end of 24 weeks, the percent age of ACR20 was 70% (21/30), ACR50 30% (9/30) and ACR70 10% (3/30). The levels of IL-6 (46.83+/-35.81 vs. 20.92+/-17.98, P=0.001), TNF-alpha (162.52+/-107.63 vs. 18.32+/-14.36, P=0.026) and INF-gamma (67.79+/-43.76 vs. 35.78+/-27.51, P=0.004) were significantly higher than those of the health control at baseline, respectively. The levels of TNF-alpha (123.36+/-89.61,P=0.018), INF-gamma (41.53+/-13.49, P=0.015), IL-1beta (7.47+/-7.33, P=0.026), IL-6 (26.01+/-25.64, P=0.025) were significantly decreased after treatment with methotrexate. In contrast, IL-10 was remarkably increased (71.76+/-41.01, P=0.02). Methotrexate is effective in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It can suppress the symptoms and joint damage. In addition, methotrexate treatment decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, and increases the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine.	NA	Beijing da xue xue bao.

28432523	Journal Article	Current ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) provide a preliminary definition of inflammatory articular disease. This study aimed to further characterize PsA peripheral arthritis using purely data-driven approaches for the affected joint distribution pattern. PsA patients from the Swiss Clinical Quality Management in Rheumatic Diseases (SCQM) database were clustered according to similarities in 66 swollen and in 68 tender joints. Clusters were compared in terms of other disease characteristics and studied for coincidence with traditional PsA subtypes, stability over time and treatment response upon first tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) therapy. Clustering of 957 patients resulted in an oligoarticular, a polyarticular hand dominated, a polyarticular foot dominated and a fourth cluster which was characterized by polyarticular involvement of the hands and feet. Of the traditional PsA subtypes, only a non-PsA-specific oligoarticular joint involvement pattern was retrieved by clustering. When comparing clusters in other disease manifestations, only minor and clinically probably irrelevant differences occurred. Over time, clusters were more robust than traditional PsA subtypes. Patients in different joint clusters had similar response rates upon first anti-TNF-α therapy, and minimal disease activity was achieved in 56% of 285 patients, irrespective of cluster membership. Hypothesis-free approaches to group PsA patients yield clusters with improved consistency, but without clinically important differences. Taken together, the current peripheral arthritis definition by GRAPPA without further specification into subtypes is strongly supported by the data.

19894053	English Abstract	Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a cross-sectional imaging procedure allows a three-dimensional representation of musculature, ligaments, tendons, capsules, synovial membranes, bones and cartilage with high resolution quality. An activity assessment is further possible by application of a contrast medium (gadolinium-DTPA) to differentiate between active and chronic inflammatory processes. Evidence of a bone marrow edema detected by MRI in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be interpreted as a prognostic and predictive factor for the development of bone erosions. On the basis of these advantages MRI is being employed more and more in the early diagnosis of inflammatory joint diseases. Semi-quantitative scores for analysis and grading of findings have already been developed and are in clinical use. Because MRI technical performances are invariably reproducible they can be practically retrieved in the course of examination which is particularly relevant in rheumatology. Therapy response or progression can thus be adequately displayed. Open, dedicated low-field MRI with a low signal strength of 0.2 Tesla (T) has been known since the 90s and now represents new MRI examination options in rheumatology. Smaller devices with lower acquisition and maintenance expenses as well as considerably more convenience due to the device itself result in a higher subjective acceptability by the patients as well as objectively more data records of low-field MRI scans of RA, which underline the significance of this new technical method. The German Society for Rheumatology (DGRh), represented by the Committee for \&quot;Diagnostic Imaging\&quot;, meets this development with the release of recommendations and standards for the procedures of low-field MRI and their scoring and summarizes the most important technical data and information on clinical indications.

12415582	Journal Article	To describe clinical and radiological findings in patients with very early arthritis (&lt; 3 months of symptoms) during one year of observation. In an Austrian multicenter setting, patients were eligible if they had nontraumatic swelling or pain in at least one joint and laboratory signs of inflammation [elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, or rheumatoid factor (RF)] within the last 3 months. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed every 3 months. Radiographs of hands and feet were taken at entry and after one year. Treatment decisions were left to the discretion of the participating center. In total, 108 patients included between 1996 and 2000 had followup investigations during at least one year; 61.1% of these patients had rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Over 65% of RA diagnoses were made at the first visit. Lag time to referral was significantly longer in patients with RA than in patients with other inflammatory joint diseases (median 8 vs 4 weeks). Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs were started 19 +/- 10 (mean +/- SD) weeks after symptom onset in patients with RA. Patients with RA improved significantly (by American College of Rheumatology response criteria and the Disease Activity Score 28) during the first year. Erosions were present in 12.8% of RA patients\&#39; initial radiographs, compared to 27.6% after one year. Odds ratio to develop new erosions during the first year of RA was 9.7 (95% CI 1.05-89.93) in RF+ patients compared to RF- individuals (p &lt; 0.05). When early referral of patients with arthritis is encouraged, RA can be diagnosed and treatment initiated early, with significant clinical response. Moreover, patients with RA tend to be referred later than patients with other inflammatory joint diseases; RA patients at this very early stage have low frequency of joint damage; and RF predicts erosions in the first year.

15895884	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is chronic inflammatory disease in which cytokines play an important role. The aim of present study was to evaluate the exon 5 +3953 IL-1beta and IL-2 -330 promoter polymorphisms in patients with RA in association with disease activity and severity. In the study 93 patients with rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed according to the criteria of American College of Rheumatology were included. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for analysis of the polymorphisms studied. The distribution of IL-1beta and IL-2 genotypes in RA patients did not differ from control subjects. Nevertheless in patients with A2 allele of IL-1beta and GG genotype of IL-2, the active form of RA was more frequently diagnosed. Moreover in these patients the measurements of disease activity (DAS 28 score, ESR, number of swollen and tender joints) were significantly increased. We suggest that exon 5 +3953 IL1beta and IL-2 -330 promoter polymorphisms may be a genetic risk factor for RA severity.

17469099	Journal Article	To determine whether patients with undifferentiated arthritis (UA; inflammatory, nontraumatic arthritis that cannot be diagnosed using current classification criteria) benefit from treatment with methotrexate (MTX). The PRObable rheumatoid arthritis: Methotrexate versus Placebo Treatment (PROMPT) study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multicenter trial involving 110 patients with UA who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1958 criteria for probable RA. Treatment started with MTX (15 mg/week) or placebo tablets, and every 3 months the dosage was increased if the Disease Activity Score was &gt;2.4. After 12 months, the study medication was tapered and discontinued. Patients were followed up for 30 months. When a patient fulfilled the ACR criteria for RA (primary end point), the study medication was changed to MTX. Joint damage was scored on radiographs of the hands and feet. In 22 of the 55 patients (40%) in the MTX group, UA progressed to RA compared with 29 of 55 patients (53%) in the placebo group. However, in the MTX group, patients fulfilled the ACR criteria for RA at a later time point than in the placebo group (P = 0.04), and fewer patients showed radiographic progression over 18 months (P = 0.046). This study provides evidence for the efficacy of MTX treatment in postponing the diagnosis of RA, as defined by the ACR 1987 criteria, and retarding radiographic joint damage in UA patients.

The modern laboratory diagnostic of rheumatoid arthritis includes detection of large spectrum of biomarkers (autoantibodies, indicators of acute phase of inflammation, cytokines, markers of activation of endothelium, subpopulations of lymphocytes, products of metabolism of bone and cartilaginous tissue, genetic markers) in blood, synovial fluid, and synovial tissue. Alongside with common techniques of immunodiagnostics, the multiplex analysis of biomarkers based on genetic, transcript and proteomic technologies is applied. The results of identification of biomarkers are an important instrument of early diagnostics, activity evaluation, severity of disease course and disease prognosis and effectiveness of applied therapy. Among biomarkers associated with rheumatoid arthritis the most clinical value have antibodies (rheumatoid factor class IgM, antibodies to citrullinized proteins) and acute phase indicators (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) which are diagnostic criteria of rheumatoid arthritis and can be used in evaluation of prognosis of this disease. On basis of multi-parametric analysis of 12 key proteins of blood serum the new index of activity of rheumatoid arthritis (Vectra DA) is developed Nowadays, the potential biomarkers are detected providing to implement immunologic monitoring and prognosis of effectiveness of therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with genetic engineering biologic preparations. The laboratory tests are developed to evaluate immunogenicity of genetic engineering biologic preparations and diagnostic of latent tuberculosis infection in patients with rheumatoid arthritis against the background of therapy with using this group of pharmaceuticals.

29400369	Journal Article	The aim of our study was to analyze the level of the glycoprotein YKL-40 in patients with active knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to search possible correlations with local inflammation and ultrasound (US) findings. A prospective study with fifty consecutive patients with active knee OA (diagnosed based on the American College of Rheumatology criteria for OA with radiographic confirmation) was performed. Concentrations of YKL-40 in serum and synovial fluid were measured by ELISA. US examinations - Gray scale (GS) US and Power Doppler (PD) US - of the knee was performed according to international guidelines. The suprapatellar, medial and lateral parapatellar recesses were scanned in each knee to evaluate synovial hypertrophy and vascularization. Forty women (mean age 61.50±11.33 years old) and 10 men (aged 68.50±6.60 years old) were enrolled. We found that the synovial level of the glycoprotein (237.80±104.08 ng/ml) was significantly higher compared to the serum concentration (112.83±60.61 ng/ml, p&lt;0.001). The serum concentration in OA patients was higher comparing with age-matched healthy controls (84.19±11.39 ng/ml) (p&lt;0.05). A statistically significant association between YKL- 40 in synovial fluid and serum levels was shown. We determined a moderately positive linear relationship between the synovial level of the glycoprotein and the serum concentration. No association between the levels of inflammatory markers - erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein - and YKL-40 concentrations was detected. Our study revealed a strong relationship between YKL-40 in synovial fluid and GS US and feeble with PD US. YKL-40 correlated with inflammatory activity in knee joints and neovascularization detected by US. YKL-40 is involved in the pathogenesis of OA synovitis. Evaluation of YKL-40 levels in parallel with US might provide more sensitive and reliable information for the diagnosis and understanding of OA.

29043493	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory condition which may cause pain, stiffness and fatigue. People who have RA have reduced levels of physical activity due to these symptoms. Interventions targeting physical activity behaviour in this population have had limited efficacy. This paper describes a protocol for a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a theory-based intervention delivered in a community setting designed to promote physical activity in people who have RA. The aim of the pilot study is to assess the impact of the intervention on moderate-intensity physical activity in people with RA. The objectives are to obtain reliable estimates regarding recruitment rates; participant retention, protocol adherence and generate potential effect size estimates to inform sample size calculations for a main trial on physical activity participation. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a selected sample of participants to explore their experiences. Participants will be recruited from direct referrals from the rheumatology clinics in a public hospital. Participants meeting inclusion criteria will be randomised into a 6 week physical activity intervention (four sessions delivered over a 6-week period by a trained physiotherapist) or a control group (physical activity information leaflet). Results of the pilot study will provide data to determine if a larger RCT is feasible. Qualitative data will inform intervention design and delivery. The findings will be disseminated to health professionals, in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

28089978	Journal Article	Several aspects of rituximab (RTX) retreatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) need to be further elucidated. The aim of this study was to describe the effect of repeated courses of RTX on disease activity and to compare 2 retreatment strategies, fixed-interval versus on-flare retreatment, in a large international, observational, collaborative study. In the first analysis, patients with RA who received at least 4 cycles with RTX were included. In the second analysis, patients who received at least 1 RTX retreatment and for whom information about the strategy for retreatment was available were identified. Two retreatment strategies (fixed-interval vs on-flare) were compared by fitting-adjusted, mixed-effects models of 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) over time for first and second retreatment. A total of 1530 patients met the eligibility criteria for the first analysis. Significant reductions of mean DAS28 between the starts of subsequent treatment cycles were observed (at start of first treatment cycle: 5.5; second: 4.3; third: 3.8; and fourth: 3.5), suggesting improved response after each additional cycle (p &lt; 0.0001 for all pairwise comparisons). A total of 800 patients qualified for the second analysis: 616 were retreated on flare and 184 at fixed interval. For the first retreatment, the fixed-interval retreatment group yielded significantly better results than the on-flare group (estimated marginal mean DAS28 = 3.8, 95% CI 3.6-4.1 vs 4.6, 95% CI 4.5-4.7, p &lt; 0.0001). Similar results were found for the second retreatment. Repeated treatment with RTX leads to further clinical improvement after the first course of RTX. A fixed-interval retreatment strategy seems to be more effective than on-flare retreatment.

27800090	Journal Article	The shoulder involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is common. It can be subclinical and compromise the function of the upper limb. Musculoskeletal ultrasonography can detect subclinical abnormalities in rheumatoid shoulder. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of ultrasound abnormalities in rheumatoid shoulder, and investigate their association with different parameters. Cross-sectional study including 37 patients with RA, meeting the ACR/EULAR 2010 classification criteria, who were enrolled during a month. A questionnaire with sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data was filled in for all patients. Ultrasound evaluation was performed by a single experienced operator. For each patient, both of shoulders were evaluated. Mean age was 50 years with female predominance. Median disease duration of RA was 7.5 years. All patients had a seropositive form of RA. Mean clinical DAS28 was 5.1. Mean HAQ was 1.2. Thirty-one (83.8%) patients had involvement of the shoulder: unilateral in 9(24.3%) cases and bilateral in 22(59.5%) cases. Synovitis was found in 16(43.2%) patients with Doppler in 4 (10.8%) cases. Sub-acromial bursitis was noted in 14 (37.8%) cases and the effusion in 20 (54.1%). Synovitis was noted especially in elderly individuals (p: 0.01). The Doppler was visualized in elderly patients (p: 0.01), with a shorter disease duration (p: 0.02) and with a high SDAI (p: 0.006). US inflammatory findings in anterior recess of glenohumeral joint were linked to a higher synovial index (p: 0.03) and a higher level of rheumatoid factor (p: 0.01). 59.5% of our RA patients had bilateral involvement of the shoulder which was related to the disease activity. Ultrasound should be a systematic tool to look for the involvement of this joint in RA patients.

7639798	Comparative Study	To measure serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and tissue inhibitor of MMP-1 (TIMP-1) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and in age-matched control subjects, and to determine how these correlate with serum levels of antigenic keratan sulfate (KS) and other biochemical and clinical indicators of disease activity. Immunoassays were used to measure levels of MMP-1, MMP-3, TIMP-1, and antigenic KS. Radiologic and functional joint scores were based upon Steinbrocker\&#39;s criteria. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) and levels of C-reactive proteins (CRP) were measured. In RA patients, levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 were significantly increased, and strongly correlated with the ESR and CRP levels but not with radiologic or functional joint scores. Levels of antigenic KS were significantly lower in RA patients and correlated negatively with systemic parameters of inflammation and serum levels of TIMP-1. The increase in serum levels of MMP-3 and TIMP-1 appears to reflect systemic inflammation in RA. The inverse correlation between serum levels of TIMP-1 and antigenic KS suggests that an upregulation of TIMP-1 synthesis might be responsible for the apparent suppression of cartilage aggrecan catabolism in patients with severe inflammatory changes.

26323729	Comparative Study	Tenoxicam is widely used in osteoarthritis treatment and we aimed to compare the effectivity of oral and intra-articular administration of tenoxicam in osteoarthritis treatment. This study was performed between 2011 and 2012 by retrospectively analyzing and comparing the findings of 60 patients who were clinically and radiologically diagnosed with knee degenerative osteoarthritis in Bünyan state hospital pain policlinic. 60 patients included in the study were divided into two groups. The first group (tenoxicam IA, n=30) included patient findings of those subjected to intra-articular injection of 20mg tenoxicam to the knee once a week for three weeks and the second group (oral tenoxicam, n=30) included patients who were administered 20mg oral tenoxicam once a day for three weeks. All patients were clinically evaluated pre-treatment and in the 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month post-treatment according to specified criteria. Twenty two of 60 patients included in the study were male and 38 were female. In both groups significant improvements were detected in all of the observed parameters: visual analog scale, Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (pain, physical activity, knee stiffness) and Lequesne index scores and in the evaluations performed in 1st week, 1st month and 3rd month with respect to pre-treatment values. Besides, a better compliance to treatment and gastrointestinal system tolerability in tenoxicam IA group was also observed. Intra-articular tenoxicam administration could be thought as an alternative treatment method in patients with knee osteoarthritis who cannot use oral tenoxicam especially due to systemic gastrointestinal system side effects and those who have difficulties in adapting to treatment.

8403763	Journal Article	In an attempt to demonstrate whether clinically selected joints of the hand in active rheumatoid disease had consistent MRI findings, 45 patients were examined, in whom one joint in each was selected by both the referring clinician and patient as being active and symptomatic. Such joints, in order to be included in the study, were required to conform to ARA criteria of activity and usually mild to moderate X-ray changes. The joints were imaged using spin-echo sequences with T1W and T2W precontrast images, followed by T1W images after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA. Different patterns of joint abnormalities were found. In 27 joints MRI findings suggested highly active synovitis and/or destructive pannus. In four, crescentic enhancement was thought to be compatible with simple synovitis, but in 23 rounded masses of synovial proliferation were characterized by marked, diffuse contrast enhancement on T1W postcontrast images, which corresponded well with high signal intensity on T2W images. Synovial proliferation in a further 12 joints was shown by only moderate stippled contrast enhancement and nonhomogeneous intermediate to high signal intensity on T2W images. These findings were thought to represent less active synovitis and pannus. MRI did not demonstrate inflammatory activity in six joints. In two of these pannus was of low signal intensity on T2W images, without contrast enhancement after Gd-DTPA infection presumed fibrotic and inert, and four were normal on all pulse sequences. These results suggest that clinical features of synovitis, even in carefully selected joints clinically, do not produce a homogeneous group when examined by MRI imaging. Indeed, a spectrum exists from presumed marked, active synovitis to total normality. If MRI is to be used as a clinical and research tool in the assessment of rheumatoid disease, and its therapeutic manipulation, these results are of some importance, since the variable findings indicate an appreciable heterogeneity of appearances in joints thought clinically to be of relatively uniform severity.

28903542	Comparative Study	Biologic therapies have become central to the long-term management of many chronic diseases, including inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Over recent years, the development and licensing pathways for biosimilars have become more standardized, and several biosimilars have been made available for patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as RA. Pre-licensing requirements for biosimilars mandate the demonstration of comparability with reference products in terms of clinical activity, safety and immunogenicity, whereas post-marketing surveillance and risk minimization requirements are set in place to ensure that long-term, real-world safety data are collected to assess biosimilars in clinical practice. These measures should provide a foundation for physician confidence in biosimilars, which can be established further through clinical experience. Biosimilars may help to fill an unmet need by improving patient access to effective biologic treatments for chronic diseases. Greater access may result in additional clinical benefits, with appropriate use of biologic therapies according to treatment guidelines being associated with improved outcomes and the potential for reduced costs of care. Key challenges for the integration of biosimilars into everyday practice include questions about interchangeability, switching and automatic substitution. Several switching studies have shown that biosimilars can be used in place of reference products while maintaining efficacy and safety. Additional ongoing studies and registries may help to optimize the process of switching, and different funding models are examining the optimal mechanisms to ensure effective uptake of these new treatments.

22133625	Journal Article	To evaluate the effect of a tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor (etanercept) on innate inflammatory and Th17 cytokines in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with active RA refractory to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs who initiated therapy with etanercept plus methotrexate (MTX). Treatment response was assessed at Week 24 according to the European League Against Rheumatism response criteria. Serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-α, IL-32, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-21, and IL-22 were measured in patients with RA and 25 healthy controls. Patients with RA had increased levels of IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001), IL-32 (p &lt; 0.001), IL-23 (p &lt; 0.001), and a trend toward increased IL-21 in the sera compared to controls. At 24 weeks\&#39; posttreatment, followup serum samples of etanercept responders had decreased levels of IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001) and increased IL-21 (p &lt; 0.05) and IL-32 (p &lt; 0.001), while there were no differences in cytokine levels in non-responders. Serum IL-6 levels were positively correlated with levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r = 0.458, p &lt; 0.01), C-reactive protein (r = 0.593, p &lt; 0.01), and 28-joint Disease Activity Score (r = 0.432, p &lt; 0.01) at baseline. Serum IL-21 levels were positively correlated with levels of rheumatoid factor (r = 0.513, r = 0.633, both p &lt; 0.01) and antimutated citrullinated vimentin antibodies (r = 0.515, p &lt; 0.01; r = 0.428, p &lt; 0.05) at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment with etanercept. Multiple inflammatory pathways contribute to persistent chronic inflammation in RA. In contrast to nonresponders, etanercept therapy modulated serum cytokine levels and caused a marked decrease of IL-6 levels in responders. IL-21 might be involved in the regulation of autoantibody production in RA.

15331394	Clinical Trial	To evaluate long term efficacy of three iterative courses of three weekly intra-articular (IA) injections of NRD101 in the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). A 1 year prospective, multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of 301 patients aged &gt;50 years with painful and radiological medial knee OA. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups receiving: (1) three courses of three IA injections of hyaluronic acid (HA) + oral placebo; (2) IA injections of saline solution + diacerein 100 mg/day; (3) IA injections of saline solution + oral placebo. Demographic data and symptomatic criteria-pain, Lequesne\&#39;s index, patient\&#39;s global assessment of disease activity, percentage of painful days-were obtained during the study; primary structural criterion was JSW. Efficacy criteria were changes in pain VAS, joint space narrowing (JSN), and percentage of progressors (JSN &gt;0.5 mm). An intention to treat analysis was used for symptomatic variables, and completer analysis for structural variables. Baseline characteristics were similar between the three groups. Mean (SD) improvement in pain VAS was clinically relevant (-33.9 (27.3), n = 301), but with no difference between the groups (p = 0.96). JSW deteriorated (-0.09 (0.55) mm, n = 277, p = 0.01), but with no difference between the groups (p = 0.82). Percentages of progressors were 17.7, 18.9, and 20.3% (p = 0.90), in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A weak but statistically significant structural deterioration occurred over 1 year, together with clinically relevant symptomatic improvement in patients receiving oral drug and iterative IA injections. Symptomatic and/or structural effects for both this new HA compound and diacerein were not demonstrated.

27062373	Comparative Study	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common inflammatory polyarthritis, which causes functional digital ulnar deviation (UD). Radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of the hands is essential in RA, but its role in the quantification of UD remains unclear. To compare UD measurements in RA patients between clinical goniometric assessments versus standardized radiographs and MRI. Fifteen RA patients with clinically apparent UD and 11 RA patients without UD underwent a rheumatological examination prior to recruitment to this study. Goniometric measurements for UD at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were performed by an occupational therapist (OT). Standardized hand radiographs, and MRI studies of the dominant hand using 3T MRI scanner with 16 channel hand/wrist coil were evaluated. Angulation measurements for radiographs and MRI were performed independently by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists who were blinded to the rheumatologist\&#39;s, occupational therapist\&#39;s and each other\&#39;s assessments. Inter-observer correlation between radiologists was &gt;0.97 for both radiographic and MRI measurements. Correlation between OT goniometric measurements and the imaging-based measurements was limited at 0.496 for radiographs and 0.317 for MRI. Correlation between imaging modalities was 0.513. Compared to OT measurements, radiographic and MRI study measurements significantly underestimate the angulation in RA patients with UD (P &lt; 0.001). The results of this study demonstrated discordance between radiological and goniometric measurements of digital ulnar angulation at the MCP joints in RA patients. Although imaging plays a key role in understanding structural damage and disease activity in RA, it should be emphasized that radiological measurements underrate joint malalignment.

16671950	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease in which interleukin (IL)-18 plays an important role. However, there are controversial reports on IL-18 promoter polymorphism as an independent marker of RA susceptibility. The aim of present study was to examine the IL-18 promoter polymorphism in patients with RA, and its association with disease susceptibility, activity and severity. We examined 309 patients with RA from a Polish population diagnosed according to the criteria of American College of Rheumatology. An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was used for analysis of the polymorphisms in positions - 137 and - 607 in promoter region of IL-18 gene. A significantly decreased number of subjects with AC/AC and AG/AG diplotypes was observed among RA patients as compared with healthy controls (OR - 0.51, 95%CI 0.28-0.95, P = 0.045) and (OR - 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.97, P = 0.042), respectively. Nevertheless, there was no significant association with disease activity, joint erosions, extra-articular manifestations, rheumatoid factor. Above results suggest that IL-18-137 and - 607 promoter polymorphisms are not the significant factors influencing RA course and severity in a Polish population.

The aim of our protocol (PMAIJ) is to supply rheumatologists and paediatricians with a useful tool for follow-up of juvenile arthritis patients using validated instruments for the evaluation of activity, functional capacity and response to treatment. PMAIJ has 2 pages. The first page is filled only at the initial evaluation; the second page is filled at first and in all the appointments after that. The application of this protocol would contribute to the standardization of procedures in different Paediatric Rheumatology Centres and would help to obtain useful information on the clinical evolution of JIA patients followed in Portugal.

The main outcome measures were response to steroids after 3 weeks (minimum 50% improvement in proximal pain, morning stiffness &lt;30 minutes, acute-phase response not elevated), relapses, QOL as measured by the Short Form 36 and Health Assessment Questionnaire, and diagnosis reassessment at 1 year. At 3 weeks, 55% of participants failed to meet our definition of a complete response to steroid therapy. Both physical and mental QOL at presentation were substantially lower than general population norms and improved by 12.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 10.8, 14.4) and 11.2 (95% CI 8.5, 13.8) points, respectively, at 1 year. Proximal pain and longer morning stiffness were significantly associated with lower physical QOL during followup, whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate was most strongly associated with lower mental QOL during followup. There was moderate agreement between clinicians in confirming the PMR diagnosis (kappa coefficients 0.49-0.65). PMR is a heterogeneous disease with a major impact on QOL. Ongoing monitoring should include disease activity based on symptoms, emergence of alternative diagnoses, and early referral of atypical and severe cases.

26308348	Journal Article	The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of increasing body mass index (BMI) in fibromyalgia (FM) and to understand the impact of increasing BMI on FM. Patients with FM were divided into 3 BMI classifications: normal weight, overweight, and obese. We then sought relationships of increasing BMI to core process FM variables and symptoms and disability, as well as medical comorbidities and demographic, socioeconomic, psychiatric, and treatment data. Of 224 patients, 0.4% were underweight; 25.9%, normal weight; 29.9%, overweight; 43.8%, obese. We found no differences within groups with regard to age, gender, demographics, FM symptoms, FM impact questionnaire scores, and meeting the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria and FM survey criteria. Patients with FM who are obese, compared with normal-weight patients, have higher depression scores measured by Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (13.2 [6.6] vs 10.5 [6], P = 0.03), report increased disability by Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index scores (1.3 [0.6] vs 0.9 [0.6], P &lt; 0.001), exercise less (8.4% vs 25.4%, P = 0.003), have more medical comorbidities (1.5 [1.3] vs 0.7 [0.9], P &lt; 0.001), take more medications for FM (3.5 [2.2] vs 2.1 [1.8], P &lt; 0.001), and report higher prevalence of abuse (48% vs 33.9%, P = 0.016) and sexual abuse (17.3% vs 6.8%, P = 0.01). Compared with normal-weight patients, obese FM patients are more disabled, report more medical comorbidities, exercise less, have a higher incidence of abuse, report increased depressive symptoms, and take more medications for FM. Bivariate analysis showed association of increasing BMI with the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (not FM impact questionnaire) and depression. We confirm that the prevalence of overweight and obesity is high in FM and believe that physicians treating FM should be aware of our bivariate linear correlations and discuss weight loss with their FM patients. Even if increasing BMI is not intrinsic to FM, it contributes to poor mood and functional outcome and should be a treatment goal.

30128732	Journal Article	In 2011 EULAR first published recommendations for the potential role of nurses in the management of patients with rheumatic diseases. To perform a literature update for the role of nurses in the management of chronic inflammatory arthritis (CIA) from 2010 to 2018. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, in accordance with the search strategies and eligibility criteria of the EULAR taskforce. The eligibility criteria were \&quot;inflammatory arthritis\&quot;, \&quot;interventions undertaken by nurses\&quot; and \&quot;relevant outcomes to answer the research questions\&quot;. Exclusion criteria were in itself contradictory outcomes, insufficient data, consideration if they did not clearly distinguish between nurses and health professionals or focused on chronic other than rheumatic diseases. Systematic reviews were classified as descriptive and excluded. Quality of selected trials was determined according to Oxford-levels of evidence 2009. A total of 48 articles and 10 abstracts were identified fulfilling the eligibility and exclusion criteria. Recommendation 1 has been well established in Europe so far. New evidence strengthens the recommendation 3, and-at least in part-recommendation 6. High evidence strengthens recommendation 4, especially for outpatients with low and stable disease activity. Some new evidence also exists for recommendations 7 and 8. This SLR reveals new evidence for the role of nurses in managing CIA patients since 2010, especially for RA-patients with low disease activity or in remission.

29342473	Comparative Study	Objective To compare outcomes in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients initiating adalimumab (ADA), with short- and long-term disease duration and to evaluate the potential effect of concomitant conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD) or glucocorticoids. Methods Analyses included adult PsA patients registered in the Rheumatic Diseases Portuguese Register (Reuma.pt) between June 2008-June 2016 who received ADA for ≥3 months. Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response, tender and swollen joint count, inflammatory parameters, patient (PtGA) and physician global assessment (PhGA), Disease Activity Score-28 joints (DAS28), and Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were compared between patients with &lt;5 years of disease (early PsA) and those with ≥5 years of disease duration (late PsA). Time to achieving PsARC response was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Of 135 PsA patients treated with ADA, 126 had information on disease duration (earlyPsA, n=41). PsARC response was achieved by 72.9% of the patients (88.0% early PsA vs 62.2% late PsA; P=0.022) after 3 months and by 85.4% after 24 months (100% early PsA vs 75.9% late PsA; P=0.044). Early PsA patients achieved significantly less painful joints (2.7 vs 6.7, p=0.006), lower mean C-reactive protein (0.5 mg/dL vs 1.3 mg/dL; P=0.011), and PhGA (18.3 vs 28.1; P=0.020) at 3 months. In the long term, early PsA patients also had fewer swollen joints (0.3 vs 1.7; P=0.030) and lower PhGA (6.3 vs 21.9; P&lt;0.001), C-reactive protein (0.4 mg/dL vs 1.0 mg/dL; P=0.026), and DAS28 (2.2 vs 3.2; P=0.030). HAQ-DI decreased in both groups reaching a mean value at 24 months of 0.4 and 0.8 (P=ns) in early and late PsA, respectively. Early PsA patients obtained PsARC response more rapidly than late PsA (3.8 and 7.4 months, respectively; P=0.008). Concomitant csDMARDs showed clinical benefit (2-year PsARC response, 88.3% vs 60.0%; P=0.044). Concomitant glucocorticoids had no effect on PsARC response over 2 years of follow-up. Persistence on ADA was similar in both groups. Conclusion Early PsA patients had a greater chance of improvement after ADA therapy and better functional outcome, and achieved PsARC response more rapidly than late PsA. In this cohort, comedication with csDMARDs was beneficial over 2 years.

6396271	Clinical Trial	Nabumetone, belonging to a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs, was administered to 9 patients suffering from radiologically-confirmed osteoarthritis of one or more of the following articulations: knees, hips, cervical and lumbar spine. A single nightly dose of 1 g was given for at least one year, and up to three years. The drug was found to be generally effective on such criteria as articular mobility, night pain, and pain during activity. No significant alterations which could be attributed to the treatment were seen in haematological parameters, blood creatinine and urea levels, protein, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and other blood and urine tests. The side-effects claimed by the patients included gastric upset, pyrosis, epigastric pain, constipation, malleolar oedema and drowsiness. These complaints did not lead to termination of the treatment. The efficacy and safety of nabumetone found in this and other studies warrant its further investigation in the treatment of rheumatic diseases.

27390225	Journal Article	To evaluate the prevalence of sacroiliitis, the radiographic hallmark of inflammatory spondyloarthropathy, among patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), using the current Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria and magnetic resonance imaging. Patients experiencing FMS (American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria) were interviewed regarding the presence of spondyloarthritis (SpA) features and underwent HLA-B27 testing, C-reactive protein (CRP) level measurement, and magnetic resonance imaging examinations of the sacroiliac joints. FMS severity was assessed by the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and the Short Form 36 health survey. SpA severity was assessed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Sacroiliitis was demonstrated among 8 patients (8.1%) and ASAS criteria for diagnosis of axial SpA were met in 10 patients (10.2%). Imaging changes suggestive of inflammatory involvement (e.g., erosions and subchondral sclerosis) were demonstrated in 15 patients (17%) and 22 patients (25%), respectively. The diagnosis of axial SpA was positively correlated with increased CRP level and with physical role limitation at recruitment. Imaging changes suggestive of axial SpA were common among patients with a diagnosis of FMS. These findings suggest that FMS may mask an underlying axial SpA, a diagnosis with important therapeutic implications. Physicians involved in the management of FMS should remain vigilant to the possibility of underlying inflammatory disorders and actively search for such comorbidities.

18668547	Journal Article	To determine whether the plasma levels of a range of inflammatory proteins have utility as biomarkers of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Plasma proteins (n = 163) were profiled in 44 patients with RA diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology 1987 criteria (22 with active and 22 with quiescent disease) and in 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The utility of a subset of differentially expressed proteins as predictors of RA disease activity was investigated using partial least-squares discriminant analysis, and their response to therapeutic intervention was evaluated in plasma from an additional cohort of 16 patients with active RA treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFalpha). The protein profiling study identified 25 proteins that were differentially expressed in plasma samples from patients with active RA (P for the false discovery rate &lt; or = 0.01) compared with those with quiescent RA, including the previously described interleukin-6 (IL-6), oncostatin M, and IL-2, and the 5 less-established markers macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 9, CCL23, transforming growth factor alpha, and CXCL13. Systemic levels of these 5 markers correlated with the C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor level, tender joint count in 68 joints, and Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and their combined plasma levels were shown to be good predictors of disease activity (kappa = 0.64). In anti-TNFalpha-treated RA patients, plasma levels of CXCL13 were reduced after 1 and 7 days of therapy, and levels of CCL23, M-CSF, and CXCL13 showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the DAS28 score. This exploratory study for biomarker discovery led to the identification of several proteins predictive of RA disease activity that may be useful in the definition of disease subphenotypes and in the measurement of response to therapy in clinical studies.

27805330	Comparative Study	Ultrasonography can be used in early Rheumatoid Arthritis to determine and to follow parameters of joint inflammation, such as effusion, synovitis, and marginal erosion that can be radiologically occult. We therefore planned a study to investigate whether Ultrasonography could provide information on signs of inflammation and destruction in Rheumatoid Arthritis affected finger joints that was not available with Radiography and compared it to the information provided by Magnetic resonance imaging. Hospital Based Descriptive Study. The study included 30 patients fulfilling American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria of Rheumatoid Arthritis with no erosions present on radiographs of hands. Erosion, Synovial thickening/vascularity, effusion and Tenosynovitis of Flexor tendon sheath / Extensor tendon sheath were assessed on both Ultrasonography and Magnetic resonance imaging. Considering Magnetic resonance imaging as gold standard sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and kappa value of Ultrasonography were calculated. Kappa value was calculated by kappa statistics to show agreement between the two modalities. Ultrasonography and Magnetic resonance imaging had near perfect agreement for detecting synovial thickening and vascularity, substantial agreement for detecting effusion, Flexor tendon sheath / Extensor tendon sheath inflammation, and only moderate agreement for detecting erosions in Metacarpophalangeal and Proximal interphalangeal joints. The early diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis by Ultrasonography and MRI is very important to early treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis. Ultrasonography is a reliable method for assessing inflammatory activity and destructive changes in small joints of hand as the Ultrasonographic findings are comparable to those of MRI.

15552515	Journal Article	Therapies for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be assessed according to relative levels of measures to compare efficacy to another therapy or to a placebo, as in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20%, 50%, or 70% (ACR 20 ACR 50 and ACR 70) responses, or by absolute levels of measures, as in disease activity scores (DAS), ACR criteria for remission, or \&quot;target values\&quot; of specific measures. Regulatory considerations have emphasized primarily relative comparisons to a placebo or standard therapy, derived in part from the weak efficacy of traditional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). While improvement compared to placebo certainly indicates efficacy, it is of concern that measures of inflammatory activity, such as swollen joints and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), may be stable or improved over periods of 5-10 years, while measures of damage, such as joint deformity and radiographic changes, may progress over the same period in the same patients. These findings suggest that improvement at a level of 20% or 50% may deter but not prevent severe long-term outcomes of radiographic progression, functional declines, work disability, and premature mortality, seen in most patients until the middle 1990s. Outcomes appear to be improved at this time, associated with aggressive treatment strategies and more powerful therapies, including biologic agents. In the Finnish Rheumatoid Arthritis Combination Therapy Trial (FinRACo), no patient who was in remission after 6 months was receiving work disability payments 4 1/2 years later, compared to 22% of patients who had ACR 20 or 50 responses and 54% of patients who did not have ACR 20 responses after 6 months who were all receiving work disability payments after 5 years. These findings suggest that absolute targets, including remission, may be realistic contemporary goals, with aggressive treatment strategies and more effective DMARDs and biologic agents.

25362660	Journal Article	Because psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory disease of joints, serum soluble biomarkers specific for chronic joint and bone inflammation may predict future disease severity and response to therapy, thereby informing stratified medicine approaches. The objectives of our systematic review were to determine whether serum soluble bone and cartilage turnover biomarkers are (1) associated with PsA or psoriatic spondyloarthropathy; and (2) associated with disease activity, disease severity, or clinical phenotype. Ten studies met eligibility criteria. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3, Dickkopf (DKK)-1, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), crosslinked telopeptide of collagen-1, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand were associated with PsA, with equivocal results for osteoprotegerin (OPG) and bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP). MMP-3, DKK-1, M-CSF, CPII:C2C (ratio of cartilage degradation vs byproduct formation), and possibly OPG were associated with PsA independently of psoriasis. C1-2C (a neoepitope released when type 2 cartilage is degraded by collagenases) was associated with both tender and swollen joint counts, and bone morphogenetic protein-4 with patient global assessment of disease, pain score, and the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index. Bone ALP was associated with disease activity. M-CSF and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand were associated with several plain radiographic features. No studies have investigated biomarker associations specifically with axial PsA.

17051361	English Abstract	Pain and loss of function are the clinical signs of osteoarthritis (OA). Conventional x-rays confirm the diagnosis or provide important hints for differential diagnosis. In the natural course of OA, x-rays are performed at longer intervals when pain increases or therapy is without effect, especially if more invasive therapies, or even surgery, becomes necessary. The advantages of x-rays are worldwide availability, cost effectiveness, very long experience with this imaging method and the possibility of storing the images for long periods of time. The typical findings of OA can be detected only roughly by quantitative methods. In many patients, grading of OA does not correlate well with the clinical symptoms. X-ray changes are part of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for OA of the hand, hip and knee. Ordinary s-rays can depicting bone with a higher local resolution than any other imaging technique. Soft tissues and cartilage can be visualized only indirectly. In OA, ultrasound is the method to depict intra-articular effusion at an early stage. Osteophytes or the degree of synovitis are also visible. Concomitant changes in tendons, bursae or cartilage, such as structures in the hip, shoulder and knee, can be evaluated. MRI is an appropriate tool for describing changes in cartilage volume and concomitant soft-tissue alterations. For qualitative cartilage imaging, MRI has, to date, not been fully validated. Bone scans (bone scintigraphy) allow the differentiation of inflammatory from degenerative joint affections and may add information on the activity of the subchondral bone, which may develop to a prognostic marker of OA. This survey represents recommendations of the Commission \&quot;Imaging Techniques\&quot; of the German Rheumatology Society regarding the technical and individual conditions, indications, practical guidance and the typical findings of imaging in OA.

12137706	Journal Article	Because of the unpredictability people with arthritis face on a daily basis, patient education programmes have become an effective complement to traditional medical treatment giving people with arthritis the strategies and the tools necessary to make daily decisions to cope with the disease. To assess the effectiveness of patient education interventions on health status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. A selection of review articles (see references) were examined to identify further relevant publications. There was no language restriction. Randomised controlled trials (RCT\&#39;s) evaluating patient education interventions that included an instructional component and a non-intervention control group; pre- and post-test results available separately for RA, either in the publication or from the studies\&#39; authors; and study results presented in full, end-of-study report. Twenty-four studies with relevant data were included. We found significant effects of patient education at first follow-up for scores on disability, joint counts, patient global assessment and psychological status. Physician global assessment was not assessed in any of the included studies. The two separate dimensions of psychological status: anxiety and depression showed no significant effects, nor did the dimensions of pain and disease activity. At final follow up no significant effects of patient education were found. Patient education as provided in the studies reviewed here had moderate short-term effects on patient global assessment, and small short-term effects on disability, joint counts and psychological status. There were no long-term benefits.

29228799	Journal Article	Calprotectin (myeloid-related protein 8/14) is elevated in inflammatory diseases and a correlation of serum calprotectin and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been shown. In this study, we investigated plasma calprotectin as a disease marker in patients with chronic RA treated with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy and compared plasma calprotectin with C-reactive protein (CRP) in this matter. Seventy-six patients with chronic RA were included in this open prospective study and of these 40 were included prior to initiation of MTX therapy. The patients were followed with laboratory and clinical parameters for 52-56 weeks. Plasma calprotectin was analyzed at the start of study and at various intervals. Radiographic evaluation was performed at baseline and after 17.2 months and progression in joint destruction was measured with Larsen score. The response to MTX was evaluated according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Patients starting MTX treatment had significantly higher levels of plasma calprotectin compared to patients well established on MTX therapy (p = .008). Among the 40 patients naive to MTX, 25 responded to MTX therapy and serum calprotectin decreased significantly in these patients (p = .0007). The radiographic damage showed no relation to calprotectin. Plasma calprotectin is associated with disease activity in patients with chronic RA and is more strongly correlated to MTX response compared to CRP. The role of calprotectin as a disease marker is promising and the advantages compared to CRP needs to be further investigated.

25807939	Journal Article	Little is known about the relationship between morning symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and measures of disease activity currently used to assess RA. Information available from the Circadian Administration of Prednisone in Rheumatoid Arthritis (CAPRA-2) study was used to investigate these relationships. CAPRA-2 included 350 patients with RA who were symptomatic despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, randomized 2:1 to additional treatment with a 5-mg daily dose of delayed-release prednisone or placebo. Pearson\&#39;s correlations were used to evaluate the relationships between change from baseline in symptoms (duration of morning stiffness, severity of morning stiffness, and intensity of pain on waking) and measures of disease activity (the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria [ACR20], the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints [DAS28], and the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index). Correlations were defined as weak (&lt;0.3), moderate (0.3-0.7), or strong (&gt;0.7). There was a strong correlation between the severity of morning stiffness and the intensity of morning pain (Pearson\&#39;s correlation 0.91, P &lt; 0.001). There was a weak correlation between the duration of morning stiffness and measures of disease activity (0.24-0.28), with moderate correlations between the severity of morning stiffness or intensity of pain on waking and DAS28 or ACR20 scores (0.44-0.48). Severity of morning stiffness showed less variability and a greater effect size than did duration of morning stiffness. Morning symptoms and measures of disease activity show weak to moderate correlations. Severity of morning stiffness showed less variability and greater effect size than did duration of morning stiffness. These findings suggest that severity is the preferred construct to measure the impact of morning stiffness in patients with RA, information that is not fully captured in the RA core set.

10400407	Journal Article	Etanercept, a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the 75kD receptor for tumour necrosis factor-alpha and the constant portion of human IgG1, is administered by subcutaneous injection and is the first specific anti-cytokine therapy approved for rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis [American College of Rheumatology (ACR) functional class I to III] who had failed to respond to previous treatment with &gt; or = 1 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), etanercept, alone or in combination with methotrexate, produced improvements in all components included in the ACR core set of disease activity measures. A dose-response effect was apparent with etanercept 0.25 to 16 mg/m2 twice weekly in a randomised, double-blind study in 180 patients. The mean number of swollen or tender joints at the end of the 12-week study decreased by &gt;50% in patients treated with etanercept 16 mg/m2 twice weekly and by &lt;25% in patients treated with placebo. In a 24-week multicentre, randomised, double-blind study in 234 patients who were not allowed to use DMARDs, etanercept 10 or 25mg twice weekly had a rapid onset of effect. Significantly more patients treated with etanercept 25mg twice weekly than placebo experienced 20 (ACR 20), 50 (ACR 50) or 70% (ACR 70) improvement in ACR criteria after 3 and 6 months. Limited evidence suggests that the therapeutic effects of etanercept are maintained for up to 2 years. Etanercept 25mg twice weekly produced significant improvement in patients receiving oral or subcutaneous methotrexate 10 to 25 mg/week in a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate (71%) than placebo plus methotrexate (27%) achieved the ACR 20 criteria after 6 months. Moreover, 39 and 15% of patients treated with etanercept plus methotrexate, but no placebo plus methotrexate recipients, had achieved the ACR 50 and ACR 70 criteria at this time. Etanercept 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly reduced disease activity in a preliminary, noncomparative study in 69 children aged &gt; or =4 years with refractory juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Although the overall frequency of infections was similar in patients treated with etanercept or placebo, upper respiratory tract infections were more common in patients treated with etanercept (29%) than placebo (16%). Injection site reactions occurred more frequently in etanercept- than placebo-treated patients, but did not bias the results of any study. When etanercept is administered alone or in combination with methotrexate in patients with refractory rheumatoid arthritis, significant reductions in disease activity occur within 2 weeks and are sustained for at least 6 months. Thus, etanercept appears to be particularly well suited for use in patients who fail to respond to treatment with DMARDs.

20425015	Journal Article	Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic inflammatory arthritic disease affecting children. Despite the availability of potent disease-modifying antirheumatic medications, most children still experience a chronic course with long periods of active disease. Goals of treatment should include achievement of disease remission with optimal physical functioning that allows children to lead normal lives with no structural joint damage. The term remission implies a complete lack of disease activity. This article focuses on recently developed preliminary criteria for inactive disease and remission in JIA. Recent studies using these new definitions demonstrate only modest rates of achievement of remission favoring children with persistent oligoarticular JIA. Children with rheumatoid factor-positive polyarticular JIA are least likely to achieve remission. Therapeutic strategies to achieve remission are also discussed.

25348033	Clinical Trial, Phase III	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a heterogeneous group of conditions with disturbed integrity of articular cartilage and changes in the underlying bone. The pathogenesis of OA is multifactorial and not just a disease of older people. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) typically used for the treatment of various rheumatic and dermatologic diseases. Three studies of HCQ in OA, including one abstract and one letter, are available and use a wide variety of outcome measures in small patient populations. Despite initial evidence for good efficacy of HCQ, there has been no randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in a larger patient group. In the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), evidence-based recommendations for the management of hand OA, HCQ was not included as a therapeutic option because of the current lack of randomized clinical trials. OA TREAT is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A total of 510 subjects with inflammatory and erosive hand OA, according to the classification criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), with recent X-ray will be recruited across outpatient sites, hospitals and universities in Germany. Patients are randomized 1:1 to active treatment (HCQ 200 to 400 mg per day) or placebo for 52 weeks. Both groups receive standard therapy (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAID], coxibs) for OA treatment, taken steadily two weeks before enrollment and continued further afterwards. If disease activity increases, the dose of NSAID/coxibs can be increased according to the drug recommendation. The co-primary clinical endpoints are the changes in Australian-Canadian OA Index (AUSCAN, German version) dimensions for pain and hand disability at week 52. The co-primary radiographic endpoint is the radiographic progression from baseline to week 52. A multiple endpoint test and analysis of covariance will be used to compare changes between groups. All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The OA TREAT trial will examine the clinical and radiological efficacy and safety of HCQ as a treatment option for inflammatory and erosive OA over 12 months. OA TREAT focuses on erosive hand OA in contrast to other current studies on symptomatic hand OA, for example, HERO [Trials 14:64, 2013]. ISRCTN46445413, date of registration: 05-10-2011.

19962615	Journal Article	A joint examination is prerequisite to a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and quantitative counts of swollen and tender joints are the most specific of the 7 RA Core Data Set measures for patient assessment. Therefore, joint counts are weighted of greater importance than the other 5 Core Data Set measures in American College of Rheumatology response criteria and all RA indices in which it is included. Nonetheless, several limitations to the joint count have been recognized: (1) poor reproducibility with a requirement to be performed by the same observer at each visit; (2) likelihood to improve with placebo treatment as much or more than the other 5 RA Core Data Set measures; (3) similar or lower relative efficiencies than global and patient measures to document differences between active and control treatments in clinical trials; (4) improvement over 5 years while joint damage and functional disability may progress; (5) lower sensitivity in detecting inflammatory activity than ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Most visits to a rheumatologist do not include a formal quantitative joint count. Quantitative patient self-report data are as sensitive to change and as informative about prognosis and outcomes as joint counts. It may be suggested that a careful qualitative (nonquantitative) joint examination, supplemented by quantitative self-report questionnaire scores to interpret physical examination findings, may be adequate to monitor patients and document changes in status in busy clinical settings.

9082592	Comparative Study	Rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease characterized by development of severe destruction of the joints caused by uncontrollable activation of cellular immunity. Activated T-lymphocytes synthesize interleukin-2 (IL-2) and specific membrane soluble receptors (sIL-2r) for this cytokine. The level of sIL-2r release is proportional to the number of molecules expressed on the membrane of activated immunocompetent cells. The data are provided for 59 patients with a significant RA diagnosis according to criteria of the American Rheumatology Board. Serum sIL-2r level was measured by enzyme immunoassay. It was found higher in RA patients than in controls (p &lt; 0.001). Concentrations of sIL-2r increased with activation of RA. It is suggested that determination of sIL-2r extends potentialities of laboratory diagnosis of RA activity which is important for evaluating effectivity of the treatment and RA prognosis.

11434475	Journal Article	Seventy-five women with rheumatoid arthritis according to the 1987 criteria of the American Rheumatism Association were examined. Mean age was 61.9 +/- 12.5 years, mean disease duration 14 years. Sixty-three were or had been on steroids (median cumulative prednisolone dose 2.5 g). Maximal voluntary knee extensor and flexor strength (Nm) was assessed at 30 degrees/s by an isokinetic dynamometer. Walking ability was expressed as walking and stair-climbing time (s). Markers of disease activity included number of swollen and tender joints, pain as recorded by the patients on a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disability as scored by the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Muscle strength, walking time (50 m) and stair-climbing time were reduced on average by 30%, and increased by 28% and 54% (p&lt;0.0001), respectively, compared to 67 age-, weight- and height-matched healthy women. Associations between muscle strength and cumulative or current steroid dose were not found after correction for age and disease duration. Significant linear correlations were found between knee extensor strength and walking time (r =-0.78, p&lt;0.0001) and stair-climbing time (r = -0.76, p&lt;0.0001). Similar correlations were found for flexor strength. The correlations remained significant (Rpartial ranging from -0.64 to -0.69, p&lt;0.0001) in multiple regression analyses adjusting for age, height, weight, disease duration, number of swollen and tender joints, and VAS and HAQ scores. In conclusion, negative effects of steroids on muscle strength were not demonstrated. Leg muscle strength is an important and independent determinator of walking ability in RA.

6356905	Clinical Trial	The diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis remains primarily clinical. Available diagnostic criteria represent minimum requirements and cannot adequately describe the broad areas of variability in clinical manifestations, natural history, and severity, nor the probable heterogeneity in etiology and pathogenesis. Host factors that determine clinical course and response to treatment are poorly defined and often not considered in therapeutic trials. Traditionally, treatments have developed empirically, and only later have efforts been made to account for mechanisms of action. The modern approach, however, involves the screening of a large number of promising agents and their analogues, using both animal models and in vitro systems. In osteoarthritis, pain relief has been the primary target; additional measures have aimed at reducing the impact of mechanical stress. The increasing realization that inflammation may contribute to the disruption of cartilage in osteoarthritis has raised questions about the importance of anti-inflammatory activity in therapeutic agents. These effects are also important in rheumatoid arthritis, but the extraordinary complexity of its pathogenesis confounds therapeutic efforts since it is unclear which facet or aspect of the process is most relevant. Thus, the approaches to therapy include classic anti-inflammatory agents, pheresis, chemical and radioactive cytotoxicity, and immunomodulation. The risks and benefits of these efforts are demonstrable in relatively short-term trials, but the ultimate goal of disease modification over a period of years is still elusive and difficult to document.

20510232	Journal Article	Quantitative clinical monitoring of musculoskeletal conditions and inflammatory joint diseases is challenging. Traditional measures to assess rheumatoid arthritis (RA), such as joint assessment, laboratory, imaging, and patient self-report measures, have limitations and provide only a reflection of the underlying inflammatory process. A gold standard to define disease activity in RA does not exist and various indices of disease activity must be used. Standard quantitative monitoring with a treatment goal has been shown to be beneficial to patient outcomes in randomized clinical trials. Quantitative monitoring has also contributed to improved long-term outcomes for RA in clinical care. Challenges of the measures need to be recognized and hurdles identified that prevent quantitative monitoring in every-day clinical care concerning disease activity and beyond. These aspects are discussed in this article.

8553653	Journal Article	Osteoarthritis is a disorder of cartilage that affects almost 85% of the population by age 75. A lack of rigorous clinical and radiographic criteria for defining the disorder makes precise determination of its prevalence impossible. The process of wear and tear explains many manifestations of osteoarthritis, but it does not account for some of the clinical findings or the biochemical changes in osteoarthritic cartilage. Thus, other factors such as heredity, hormones, and diet may play a role. Treatment consists of teaching patients about their disease, alleviating pain, and preserving joint function. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be no more effective than simple analgesics in relieving the pain of this disorder. Moreover, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can adversely affect cartilage metabolism, and most are possibly dangerous in elderly patients. Drugs that inhibit the production or activity of chondrolytic enzymes can slow the degeneration of cartilage in some animals, but their effects on humans with osteoarthritis are unproved. The surgical repair of severely damaged joints can have gratifying results.	NA	The Western journal of medicine	4.Bronze	Osteoarthritis.

30237627	Journal Article	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common systemic inflammatory diseases, but its etiology is still not fully known. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess what particular comorbidities are involved in the progression of RA and determine the influence that the aforementioned diseases have on each other. Forty patients with diagnosed RA according to EULAR/ACR criteria from 2010 were included in the study. The majority of the group was female (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35; 87.5%). Patients were tested using routine laboratory and imaging methods allowing diagnosis and assessment of disease activity. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry was also evaluated for mineral density. The activity of the disease was assessed using the disease activity score DAS28 (ESR) and SDAI (Simplified Disease Activity Index). Among studied patients, based on the DAS28 index, 9 patients were in the remission phase (22.5%) and 12 (30%) had high disease activity. Increased values of CRP were observed in the majority of patients (65%). The group analysis demonstrated the most common comorbidities in patients with RA, as follows: hypertension (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14; 35%) and osteoporosis or osteopenia (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13; 32.6%). Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more susceptible to developing hypertension and osteoporosis. We did not observe a significant association between other comorbidities and activity of RA. The next study will assess a larger number of patients.

23984829	Journal Article	The medicinal activity of COX-2 inhibitors are sufficiently beneficial to urge the search for new drug designs. This study presents 16 analogs of lumiracoxib and 10 analogs to valdecoxib having properties suitable as COX-2 inhibitors. For lumiracoxib analogs the mean Log P, polar surface area, and formula weight are 3.00, 70.46 A(2), and 276.60, respectively. For valdecoxib analogs the mean Log P, polar surface area, and formula weight are 3.65, 68.46 A(2), and 322.32, respectively. Grubb\&#39;s test analysis of seven properties for seven known COX-2 selective inhibitors and those of 26 analog compounds indicated no outliers. The unpaired t-test compared Log P and polar surface area of seven known COX-2 inhibitors to all 26 analogs and found no difference. All 26 analogs showed no violation of the Rule of 5, this being an indicator of favorable bioavailability. Hierarchical cluster analysis by single linkage indicated lumiracoxib is most similar to analogs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Valdecoxib has highest similarity to analogs 8, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, and 28. Multiple regression analysis successfully produced equations for prediction of similar compounds to lumiracoxib and valdecoxib. Path analysis indicated that number of atoms, oxygen &amp; nitrogen atoms, and Log P are the greatest determinants for formula weight for known COX-2 inhibitors. Criteria for molecular properties is established for identifying COX-2 inhibitors. These 26 analogs show much potential for active COX-2 inhibition.

17343248	Journal Article	The objectives of treatment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are to reduce temporary symptoms due to inflammatory activity and, more importantly, to preserve function. The introduction of potent disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in recent years has increased the opportunities for effective treatment. However, these treatments come at a substantially higher cost than traditional DMARDs and therefore compete with other essential interventions for limited resources. They have triggered a debate on whether they represent an efficient use of resources, which patients should be treated, when, and for how long. Cost-effectiveness analysis attempts to estimate the trade-offs involved in these decisions and to provide information that can help in making them. However, in chronic progressive diseases, health gains and any potential associated economic benefits are often most evident in the long-term. As a consequence, the impact of new treatments has to be estimated using models that can project available knowledge, such as results from clinical trials or short-term follow-up studies in clinical practice, into the future. These models also allow scenarios to be explored that provide the best value for money, for example by defining subgroups for which treatment is most effective, or criteria that define when treatment should be stopped. Economic evaluation in RA has a long tradition, with the first study performed about 20 years ago. However, with the recent drug introductions, the field has witnessed an explosion of economic studies. Modelling techniques have become more sophisticated to overcome concerns about their validity. At the same time, they may appear less transparent, making it difficult for non-specialists to understand the details. This article, rather than reviewing all published models and comparing them, attempts to illustrate the inputs required for such studies, and the influence that different approaches and datasets can have on the results.

8612028	Clinical Trial	Thirty-eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis meeting American College of Rheumatism (ACR) criteria were entered in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 6 months to assess whether monthly treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone (MP) enhances or accelerates the efficacy of sulphasalazine (SSZ). All patients had failed at least one second-line agent and were randomized to receive SSZ (2g/day) and pulses of MP (5 mg/kg), or SSZ+ (2 g/day) and pulses of saline (SA). A single infusion of 2 h was carried out in both groups for a total of three times (0, 1 and 2 months). The two groups were comparable at baseline regarding their demographic and clinical characteristics. Disease activity was evaluated every 2 months by means of: (1) joint count; (2) morning stiffness; (3) grip strength; (4) visual analogue pain score; (5) health assessment questionnaire; and (6) erythrocyte sedimentation rate. All outcome measures improved significantly in both groups (P &lt; 0.001). Evaluation at each follow-up visit showed no significant differences between the groups in any of the adverse effects attributable to SSZ therapy (one SA vs two MP). Adverse effects attributable to SA/MP therapy were rare and mild. We concluded that repeated pulses of MP during the first 3 months of treatment did not improve the efficacy of SSZ. Therefore, there is no justification for using MP in this way during the induction phase of SSZ therapy.

28582403	Journal Article	The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in T helper cell sub-types and osteoclast (OCs) precursors in peripheral blood between patients affected by early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) and healthy controls. The effect of administration of cholecalcipherol on clinical and laboratory parameters was subsequently evaluated, by a parallel, randomized double blind, placebo controlled trial. Thirty nine eRA patients and 31 age-matched controls were enrolled and compared for levels of 25OH vitamin D, T helper cell sub-types, OCs precursors including both classical and non-classical and pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline. Eligible patients were female ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA, as defined by the American College of Rheumatology 2010 criteria for &lt;6 months prior to inclusion in the study. Patients with auto-immune or inflammatory diseases other than RA were excluded. Patients treated with glucocorticoids (GCs), disease modifying activity drugs and biologic agents within the past 6 months were also excluded. In the second phase of the study, eRA patients were randomly assigned to standard treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and GCs with (21) or without (18) cholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) and followed for 3 months; the randomization was done by computer generated tables to allocate treatments. Three patients didn\&#39;t come back to the follow up visit for personal reasons. None of the patients experienced adverse events. The main outcome measures were T cells phenotypes, OCs precursors and inflammatory cytokines. Secondary outcome measure were clinical parameters. In eRA, 25OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower. CD4+/IFNγ+,CD4+/IL4+, CD4+/IL17A+ and CD4+IL17A+IFNγ+, cells were increased in eRA as well as non-classical OCs precursors, whereas T regulatory cells were not altered. TNFα, TGFβ1, RANKL, IL-23 and IL-6 were increased in eRA. Non-classical OCs, IL-23 and IL-6 correlated with disease severity and activity. Standard treatment with MTX and GC ameliorated clinical symptoms and reduced IL-23, whereas it did not affect CD4+ cells sub-sets nor OCs precursors. After 3 months, the combined use of cholecalcipherol significantly ameliorated the effect of treatment on global health. In eRA, a significant imbalance in T CD4+ sub-types accompanied by increased levels of non-classical OCs precursors and pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. A single dose of cholecalcipherol (300,000 IU) combined with standard treatment significantly ameliorates patients general health.

12124856	Clinical Trial	To examine the safety and efficacy of an extract of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). An ethanol/ethyl acetate extract from the roots of TWHF was prepared and used in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with longstanding RA in whom conventional therapy had failed. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose (180 mg/day) or high-dose (360 mg/day) extract for 20 weeks, followed by an open-label extension period. Clinical responses were defined as 20% improvement in disease activity according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Side effects were actively queried and recorded at each visit. A total of 35 patients were enrolled in the trial; 21 patients completed the 20-week study. One patient from each group withdrew because of side effects. Twelve, 10, and 10 patients in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, completed at least 4 weeks of treatment. Of these patients, 8 and 4 in the high-dose and low-dose groups, but none in the placebo group, met criteria for clinical response. Four, 4, and 7 patients in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose groups, respectively, were enrolled in the open-label extension; of these, 2, 4, and 5 patients, respectively, met criteria for clinical response. The most common side effect was diarrhea, which caused 1 patient in the high-dose group to withdraw from the trial. No patients withdrew because of adverse events during the open-label extension. The ethanol/ethyl acetate extract of TWHF shows therapeutic benefit in patients with treatment-refractory RA. At therapeutic dosages, the TWHF extract was well tolerated by most patients in this study.

1914839	Journal Article	After a brief exposition on the physiopathology of cartilage, and characteristic features of chondrocytes and proteoglycans (PGs) in osteoarthritis (OA), it is underlined how different molecules of GAGs and aggregated PGs added to the culture media can prevent damage and reduction of GAGs and fibril production in chondrocytes cultured with NSAIDs and corticosteroids. In animal models of OA, the local or general administration of GAGPS reduces the proteinase activity, the level of uronic acid in synovial fluid and the number of inflammatory cells in synovia. In the Pond-Nuki dog, GAGPS improves the cartilage surface. These favourable events can also occur in human OA, where it is, moreover, difficult to monitor the patients. For this purpose, patients must be selected in the first two stages of primary OA, and followed using NMR, the only device able to scan cartilage and subchondral bone, to determine their consistency and thickness, and to provide information on water content.

18276738	Journal Article	Recommendations and/or guidelines represent a popular way of integrating evidence-based medicine into clinical practice. The 3E Initiatives is a multi-national effort to develop recommendations for the management of rheumatic diseases, which involves a large number of experts combined with practising rheumatologists addressing specific questions relevant to clinical practice. Ten countries participated in three rounds of discussions and votes concerning the management of AS. A set of nine questions was formulated in the domains of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment, after a Delphi procedure. A literature search in MedLine was conducted. Predefined outcome parameters for the domains of diagnosis, monitoring and treatment were assessed. The evidence to support each proposition was evaluated and scored. After discussion and votes, the final recommendations were presented using brief statements by each national group, following which the final international recommendations were formulated. A total of 2699 papers were found and 467 were selected for analysis. Twelve key recommendations were developed: three in the domain of diagnosis addressing general diagnostic considerations, early AS diagnosis and general practitioners\&#39; referral recommendations; three concerning monitoring of AS disease activity, severity and prognosis; six concerning pharmacological treatment (except biologics): non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/COX-II inhibitors, bisphosphonates and treatment of enthesitis. The compiled agreement among experts ranged from 72% to 93%. Recommendations for the management of AS were developed using an evidence-based approach followed by expert/physician consensus with high level of agreement. Involvement of a larger and more representative group of rheumatologists may improve their dissemination and implementation in daily clinical practice.

15454128	Journal Article	Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory condition of unknown etiology characterized by aching and stiffness in the shoulder and in the pelvic girdles and neck. In the past, PMR was considered a manifestation of giant cell arteritis (GCA) or a variant of elderly-onset rheumatoid arthritis (EORA). The current diagnostic criteria for PMR were empirically formulated by clinical experts who had studied the disease extensively. Arthroscopic, radioisotopic and magnetic resonance imaging studies all have indicated the presence of a synovitis in proximal joints and periarticular structures. The synovitis is probably responsible for the musculoskeletal symptoms in PMR. The prominence assigned to the proximal symptoms has probably overshadowed the less well recognized and more variable distal musculoskeletal manifestations which are present in about half of the cases. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate does not exclude a diagnosis of PMR. C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 seem to be more sensitive indicators of disease activity both at diagnosis and during relapse/recurrence. Corticosteroids are the drugs of choice for treating PMR. A course of treatment of 1-2 years is often required. However, some patients have a chronic, relapsing course and require low doses of corticosteroids for several years.
